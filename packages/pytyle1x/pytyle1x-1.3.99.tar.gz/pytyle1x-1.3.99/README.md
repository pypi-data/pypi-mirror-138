PyTyle is an extremely versatile and extensible tiling manager that is meant
to be used on top of EWMH-compliant window managers. Its feature set was modeled after
the basic tiling features of XMonad. It works best with Openbox.

This is a fork of the [original PyTyle](http://github.com/BurntSushi/pytyle1). Unlike its predecessor, it uses Python 3. It also has more features, better documentation and many bugfixes.

Check out [the wiki](https://gitlab.com/zehkira/pytyle1x/-/wikis/home) for installation instructions.

PyTyle1x will no longer receive any updates other than bugfixes.
