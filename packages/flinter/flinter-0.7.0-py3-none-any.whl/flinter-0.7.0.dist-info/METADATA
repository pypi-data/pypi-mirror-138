# `flint`

`flint` is a source-code static analyzer and quality checker with multiple programming languages support. For `fortran`, it intends to follow the coding conventions mentioned in [OMS Documentation Wiki page](https://alm.engr.colostate.edu/cb/wiki/16983).

Many linter software exists, and are giants full of wisdom compared to the midget `flint`. The goal of `flint` is to provide a **free**, quickly installable, and customizable linter for **continuous integration**.

It also allows to graphically scan the codebase through the interactive circular packing provided by [`nobvisual`](https://pypi.org/project/nobvisual/) (which can greatly help you to monitor the code style enforcement).



## Installation

Install `flint` from PyPI's `flinter` (because `flint` was already taken):

```bash
pip install flinter
```



## Usage

`flint` provides a CLI with the following commands: 

```bash
Usage: flint [OPTIONS] COMMAND [ARGS]...

  --------------------    FLINT  ---------------------

  .      - Flint, because our code stinks... -

  You are now using the command line interface of Flint, a Fortran linter
  created at CERFACS (https://cerfacs.fr), for the EXCELLERAT center of
  excellence (https://www.excellerat.eu/).

  This is a python package currently installed in your python environment.

Options:
  --help  Show this message and exit.

Commands:
  config    Copy the default rule files locally.
  database  Create database.
  lint      Prints detailed file linting info.
  score     Score the formatting of a database, file, or folder (recursive).
  stats     Dump stats to file.
  struct    Print structure of the database, directory, or file.
  tree      Visual representation of the score with circular packing.
```



### `flint config`

It copies locally the default rules for a given language. For `fortran` it will look similar to:


```yaml
# Set active to false is you want to skip  rule
# All are regexp rules, meaning you can add new rules simply by editing this file
# test your rule on https://regex101.com/ if needed
regexp-rules:
  missing-spaces-on-do:
    message: Missing spaces
    regexp: do (\w+)=(\S+),(\S+)
    replacement: do \1 = \2, \3
    active: true

  missing-spaces-around-operator:
    message: Missing spaces around operator
    regexp: (\w|\))({operators})(\w|\()
    replacement: \1 \2 \3
    active: true

  (...)
# These are rules that span over multiple lines, not accessible by regexp
# You want to edit these rules or add your own, two options:
# - ask us.
# - fork the code.


structure-rules:
  max-statements-in-context: 50   # Subroutine of function
  max-declared-locals: 12
  min-varlen: 3
  max-varlen: 20
  max-arguments: 5
  min-arglen: 3
  max-arglen: 20
  max-nesting-levels: 5
```

You can rename the file as e.g. `my_code_my_rules.yml` and customize it for your own perusal on other commands. Simply use the `-r` optional flag:

```bash
flinter (cmd) (options) -r my_code_my_rules.yml
```


### `flint database`

It allows the creation of a database. A `flint` database contains the raw data of the parsing process. In terms of data structure, a database is a tree. In the most general case, the root corresponds to the project main directory. Each subdirectory is then its own tree node (it goes recursively). The leaves on this tree are functions/subroutines (note that a function can also be an internal node if it contains a nested function).


Here is a (partial and adapted) example taken from [`Nek5000`](https://github.com/Nek5000/Nek5000).

```json
{
 "type": "file",
 "name": "Nek5000/tools/prenek/glomod.f",
 "path": "Nek5000/tools/prenek/glomod.f",
 "size": 4719,
 "children": [
  {
   "type": "subroutine",
   "name": "glomod",
   "path": "Nek5000/tools/prenek/glomod.f/glomod",
   "size": 135,
   "children": [],
   "struct_rules": {
    "too-many-lines": {
     "num_lines": 135,
     "max_allowed": 50
    }
   },
   "regexp_rules": {
    "not-recommended-use-include": [
     {
      "line_no": 19,
      "line": "      include 'basicsp.inc'",
      "column": 6,
      "span": 7
     }
    ],
    "intrinsics-should-be-uppercased": [
     {
      "line_no": 21,
      "line": "      common /cisplit/ isplit(nelm)",
      "column": 6,
      "span": 6
     }
   ]
  }
  },
  {
   "type": "subroutine",
   "name": "frame",
   "path": "Nek5000/tools/prenek/glomod.f/frame",
   "size": 268,
   "children": [],
   "struct_rules": {
    "too-many-lines": {
     "num_lines": 268,
     "max_allowed": 50
    }
   },
   "regexp_rules": {}
   }
  ],
 "struct_rules": {},
 "regexp_rules": {},
 "top_depth": 0,
 "max_depth": 0,
 "start": 0,
 "end": 136417,
 "start_line": 0,
 "end_line": 4719
}
```


The most relevant keys are `struct_rules` and `regexp_rules`. Note how detailed the information of each error is.


A neat option when handling databases is the possibility of getting a portion of it (a subtree):

```bash
flint Nek5000/tools/prenek/glomod.f/glomod --database nek5000.json
```

creates the following file:

```json
{
 "type": "subroutine",
 "name": "glomod",
 "path": "Nek5000/tools/prenek/glomod.f/glomod",
 "size": 135,
 "children": [],
 "struct_rules": {
  "too-many-lines": {
   "num_lines": 135,
   "max_allowed": 50
  }
 },
 "regexp_rules": {
  "not-recommended-use-include": [
   {
    "line_no": 19,
    "line": "      include 'basicsp.inc'",
    "column": 6,
    "span": 7
   }
  ],
  "intrinsics-should-be-uppercased": [
   {
    "line_no": 21,
    "line": "      common /cisplit/ isplit(nelm)",
    "column": 6,
    "span": 6
   }
  ]
 }
}
```

The option to create a database is recent and was driven by the slowness associated with the parsing of very large codebases (if you have a small codebase, the chances this command is relevant for you are small).



### `flint lint`

It simplifies the reading of `regexp` errors by printing them as tables in the terminal:

```bash
>> flint lint Nek5000/tools/prenek/glomod.f

not-recommended-use-include
+---------+--------+------+-----------------------------+
| line_no | column | span |             line            |
+---------+--------+------+-----------------------------+
|    19   |   6    |  7   |       include 'basicsp.inc' |
+---------+--------+------+-----------------------------+

intrinsics-should-be-uppercased
+---------+--------+------+-------------------------------------+
| line_no | column | span |                 line                |
+---------+--------+------+-------------------------------------+
|    21   |   6    |  6   |       common /cisplit/ isplit(nelm) |
+---------+--------+------+-------------------------------------+
```



### `flint score`

It gives the score in the terminal. 

An easily parsable one-liner score is achievable with:

```bash
>> flint score Nek5000

Flinter global rating -->|-4.09|<--  (297299 statements)
```

Instead, you can have a more verbose output:

```bash
>> flint score Nek5000 --verbose --depth 1

 lvl path                                               rate       size (stmt)
  0   Nek5000                                            -4.09      297299    
  1   Nek5000/short_tests                                7.45       3054      
.........
  1   Nek5000/core                                       -7.10      89601     
.........
  1   Nek5000/tools                                      -4.53      168593    
.........
  1   Nek5000/3rd_party                                  4.45       36051     
.........
```



### `flint stats`

It shows quick statistics of a given codebase.

```bash
>> flint stats _outputs/nek5000_db.json --database -q 3

Worst rated files:
  Nek5000/tools/prenek/mxm.f: -24.23
  Nek5000/core/intp_usr.f: -23.81
  Nek5000/core/mxm_wrapper.f: -16.35

Worst rated functions:
  Nek5000/tools/postnek/big_post.f/get_velocity: -210.00
  Nek5000/tools/postnek/big_post.f/get_coords: -210.00
  Nek5000/core/intp_usr.f/intp_do: -123.33

Regexp most common errors:
  missing-space-after-punctuation: 76746
  intrinsics-should-be-uppercased: 53734
  excessive-use-of-space: 35951

Struct most common errors:
  short-varnames: 11158
  too-many-lines: 3293
  too-many-arguments: 1517
```


Additionally, it is possible to dump the errors counts to a `json` file:

```bash
flint stats _outputs/nek5000_db.json --database -q 3 --dump stats.json
```

The created file follows the structure of the database, but contains counts instead of error detailed information. You can make some funny data analysis on your code with it!

```json
[
 {
  "type": "file",
  "path": "Nek5000/tools/prenek/glomod.f",
  "size": 4719,
  "struct_nberr": 7,
  "regexp_nberr": 2,
  "struct_rules": {
   "too-many-lines": 7
  },
  "regexp_rules": {
   "not-recommended-use-include": 1,
   "intrinsics-should-be-uppercased": 1
  },
  "children": [],
  "rate": 9.921593557957195
 }
]
```


### `flint struct`

It allows to quickly understand the structure of a codebase by printing it in a tree-like way:

```bash
>> flint struct Nek5000

Nek5000
├ type: folder
├ path: Nek5000
├ size: 297299
├ Nek5000/short_tests
│ ├ type: folder
│ ├ path: Nek5000/short_tests
│ ├ size: 3054
│ ├ Nek5000/short_tests/NekTests.py
│ │ ├ type: file
│ │ ├ path: Nek5000/short_tests/NekTests.py
│ │ ├ size: 2119
│ │ ├ start_line: 0
│ │ ├ end_line: 2119
(...)
```


### `flint tree`

With

```bash
flint tree Nek5000
```

you should get a fancy circular packing view of your codebase, colored by your compliance with the coding style. The process can take some time for large codebases (in this case it is advised to create a database first).

The real heavy computation is the positioning of circles (and I could not optimize this, since this is taken from an external package, sorry). Time rise if your sources are a large heap of highly nested little files.

![exampletree](https://gitlab.com/cerfacs/flint/raw/master/docs/source/avbp_shade.png)

In this circular packing, the relative size of circles is proportional to the number of statements stored inside.


## Known bugs

Like any code, `flint` is a work in progress that still contains occasional bugs. We were able to identify the following (which will be corrected as soon as we can... it may also be your opportunity to contribute):

**Python**
* size of functions incorrect in some cases
* difficulties handling classes during the parsing

**Fortran**
* "trailing-whitespaces": "END SUBROUTINE" (wrongly) triggers it
* "one-space-after-comment" line numbers start at 0, whereas in the other cases at 1
