        Determine a projected radial grid of points from a 2D region of coordinates defined by an

        1 Given the region defined by the extent [xmin, xmax, ymin, ymax], the algorithm finds the longest 1D distance
        of the 4 paths from the (y,x) centre to the edge of the region e.g. following the positive / negative y and
        x axes.

        2: Use the pixel-scale corresponding to the direction chosen e.g. if the positive x-axis was the longest, the
        pixel_scale in the x dimension is used.

        3: Determine the number of pixels between the centre and the edge of the region using the longest path between
        the two chosen above.

        4: Create a (y,x) grid of radial points where all points are at the centre's y value = 0.0 and the x values
        iterate from the centre in increasing steps of the pixel-scale.

        5: Rotate these radial coordinates by the input `angle` clockwise.

        `relocated_grid_from()`for a full description of how this grid relocation works.

        This function operates the same as other grid relocation functions but instead returns the grid as a
        `Grid2DSparse` instance, which contains information pairing the grid to a pixelization.

        Parameters
        ----------
        grid
            The pixelization grid whose pixels are relocated to the border edge if outside it.

        Parameters
        ----------
        file_path
            The path the file is output to, including the filename and the .fits extension, e.g. '/path/to/filename.fits'
        overwrite
            If a file already exists at the path, if overwrite=True it is overwritten else an error is raised.
