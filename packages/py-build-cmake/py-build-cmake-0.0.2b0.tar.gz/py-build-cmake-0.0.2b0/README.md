## Installation

The py-build-cmake package is available on
[PyPI](https://pypi.org/project/py-build-cmake/):

```sh
pip install py-build-cmake
```

## Usage

Add a `pyproject.toml` configuration file
(see [`examples/minimal`](https://github.com/tttapa/py-build-cmake/tree/main/examples/minimal)
for detailed instructions), and use
[`pip`](https://github.com/pypa/pip), [`build`](https://github.com/pypa/build)
or another PEP 517 compatible frontend to install and/or build the package.

Build sdist and wheel packages you can upload to PyPI:
```sh
python -m build . # find the sdist and wheel file in the 'dist' folder
```

Install the package in the current environment:
```sh
pip install . # normal installation
```
```sh
pip install -e . # editable installation
```

## Examples

For example usage, see the [`examples/minimal`](https://github.com/tttapa/py-build-cmake/tree/main/examples/minimal)
and [`examples/pybind11-project`](https://github.com/tttapa/py-build-cmake/tree/main/examples/pybind11-project)
example projects.

## Documentation

The documentation can be found on <https://tttapa.github.io/py-build-cmake>.

The format of the configuration file is explained in 
[Config.md](https://tttapa.github.io/py-build-cmake/Config.html).

Alternatively, use the following command to get the documentation for all
supported options:
```sh
python -m py_build_cmake.help
