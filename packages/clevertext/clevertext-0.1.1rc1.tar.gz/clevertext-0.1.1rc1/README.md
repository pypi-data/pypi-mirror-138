## 1. OVERVIEW

`CleverText` is a convenience class that behaves almost exactly like regular Python string but also contain its own self-contained version history and record of actions.  It is mainly intented for recording and comparing different states of text (string, HTML, JSON, code etc) as various transformations (replacements, deletions, validation, parsing) are applied to it. Built in `CleverText` methods (e.g. `diff()`) are readily available for ETL style processing, and can be added easily and consistently, allowing you to segregate common text manipulation function from your main control code for example.


## 2. INSTALLATION

Very lightweight install via `pip`. No dependencies.

    python -m pip install clevertext --upgrade

Then from your Python shell just import the class...

    >>> from clevertext import CleverText


## 3. INPUT METHODS

You can create a `CleverText` instance using keyword arguments:

    >>> x = CleverText("This is the my first draft")

### **Creating Subclasses:**

If you create a subclass of `CleverText` remember to call `super().__init__()` *before* trying to set any further class or object attributes, otherwise you'll run into trouble:

    class YourTextClass(CleverText):
        def __init__(self, *args, **kwargs):
            self.setattr_direct('index', [])
            super().__init__(*args, **kwargs)



## 10. CONTRIBUTING

We'd love to see Pull Requests (and relevant tests) from other contributors, particularly if you can help:

* Tackle any of the outstanding issues listed [here](https://github.com/PFython/clevertext/issues).
* Evolve `CleverText` to make it play nicely with other classes, packages, and formats, for example `datetime`, `pandas` and `textwrap`.
* Put the finishing touches on the **docstrings** to enable autocompletion in modern IDEs (this is neither the author's strong suit nor his passion!).
* Improve the structure and coverage of `test_clevertext.py`.

For a list of all outstanding **Feature Requests** and (heaven forbid!) actual *Issues* please have a look here and maybe you can help out?

## 11. CREDITS
`CleverText` was conceived by Peter Fison and co-developed with the expert assistance of Ruud van der Ham from the friendly and excellent Pythonista Cafe forum (www.pythonistacafe.com).

It follows on from the success of [`CleverDict`](https://github.com/PFython/cleverdict) which is similar in concept and well worth checking out if you haven't already.
