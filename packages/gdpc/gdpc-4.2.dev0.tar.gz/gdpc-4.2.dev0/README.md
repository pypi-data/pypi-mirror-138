## GDPC 5.0

GDPC (Generative Design Python Client) is a framework for use in conjunction with the [Minecraft HTTP Interface Mod](https://github.com/nilsgawlik/gdmc_http_interface) built for the [GDMC competition](https://gendesignmc.engineering.nyu.edu).

Requirements are in `requirements.txt`. Functionality is not guaranteed with older versions.

You need to have Minecraft running, the mod installed and a world open to use the framework.

### Scripts:

**`example.py`**: Demonstrates all of the basic gdmc-http functionality by building a very simple village. It uses the utility functions implemented in `worldLoader.py` and `mapUtils.py`.

**`visualizeMap.py`**: Displays a map of the Minecraft world using OpenCV
