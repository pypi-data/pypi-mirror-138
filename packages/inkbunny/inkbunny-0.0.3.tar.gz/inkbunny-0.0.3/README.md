# Inkbunny

A Python wrapper for the [Inkbunny](https://inkbunny.net/) API.


## DISCLAIMER
**I have no idea what I'm doing!**

- I'm not a programmer.
- I have next to no experience with Python (or any other language for that matter).
- I have no affiliation with Inkbunny.
- This project exists because I couldn't find a Python wrapper anywhere else.
- This is still very much a work in progress.
- I'm trying my best, but my best isn't very good.

**Use this wrapper at your own risk**
