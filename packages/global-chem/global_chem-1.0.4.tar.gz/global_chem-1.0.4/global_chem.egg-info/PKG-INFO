        Global Chem is an open-source record collection for common and rare chemical lists using IUPAC as input and SMILES/SMARTS as output. As 
        mostly needed by myself as I search through chemical infinity. 
        
        I have found these lists written in history to be useful, they come from a variety of different fields but are aggregated 
        into the most common format of organic chemists (IUPAC) and the common language of the cheminformatician (SMILES) and for 
        pattern matching (SMARTS).

        Using GlobalChem
        =====================
        
        GlobalChem, initially, is one class object with a series of Nodes that are act as objects for any common chemical lists. 
        The chemical lists can be accessed as nodes and the user can construct their own node trees for the lists.
        
        An example of it's usage can be found below:
        
        
        Also since these lists of commonality are stored on github it is easily searchable and tied directly to the paper for 
        any bypasser.

        Installation 
        ============
        
        GlobalChem is going to be distribute via PyPi and as the content store grows we can expand it to other pieces of software
        making it accessible to all regardless of what you use. Alternatively, you could have a glance at the source code and copy/paste
        it yourself.
        
        ```
        
        pip install global-chem
        
        ```
        Quick Start
        ===========
        
        Just with no dependencies, intialize the class and there you go! All the common and rare groups of the world
        at your disposal 
        
        To Access Nodes:
        
        ```python
        
        from global_chem import GlobalChem
        
        gc = GlobalChem()
        gc.check_available_nodes()
        
        >>>
        'emerging_perfluoro_alkyls', 'montmorillonite_adsorption', 'common_monomer_repeating_units', 'electrophilic_warheads_for_kinases',
        ```
        
        Fetch Data from Node:
        
        ```python
        
        gc = GlobalChem()
        epa = gc.get_node('emerging_perfluoro_alkyls')
        
        epa.get_smiles()
        epa.get_smarts()
        
        >>>
        {'perfluorohexanoic acid': 'C(=O)(C(C(C(C(C(F)(F)F)(F)F)(F)F)(F)F)(F)F)O'}
        ```
        
        To Create Your Own Chemical Graph Network
        ```
        
        from global_chem import GlobalChem
        
        gc = GlobalChem()
        gc.check_available_nodes()
        gc.initiate_network()
        
        gc.add_node('common_monomer_repeating_units')
        gc.add_node('electrophilic_warheads_for_kinases', 'common_monomer_repeating_units')
        gc.add_node('common_warhead_covalent_inhibitors', 'common_monomer_repeating_units')
        gc.get_parent('common_monomer_repeating_units')    
            
        
        ```

        Data Collection
        ===============
        
        References and associatied compound lists are selected based on the interests of the scientific contributors.  This should include consideration of relevance to the scientific community. 
        The SMILES strings may be abstracted in a variety of methods:
        
        -  For simple molecules one representation of the SMILES can be directly translated using visual 
        inspection. This is typically appropriate for compounds at the beginning of a reported list that contain the most common denominator rings. 
        
        - For complex molecules the image can be redrawn in the free version of ChemDraw and then translated into SMILES. 
        
        - For sources where the SMILES are written and the IUPAC is not known the SMILES are translated into ChemDraw and the name retrieved. 
        Note that some of the names may be modified based on human inspection in favor of preferred names. 
        
        - For polymer papers, the site points were omitted from the name and some of the nomenclature adjusted for preferred names
        over traditional. For example: 'yl' to mark site points for polymer connections was removed in favor of reduced english complexity. 
        
        - In the case of radicals, some SMILES were adjusted to remove the radical chemical feature as they serve as connection points. However in some cases the radical component was maintained, especially in the case of IUPAC blue book common substituents.
        
        - SMARTS strings were adapted from the SMILES using RDKit [@Landrum:2019-5]
        
        
        Genesis
        =======
        
        GlobalChem was created because I noticed I was using the same variable across multiple scripts and figure it would be useful
        for folk to have.
