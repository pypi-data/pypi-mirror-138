        Global Chem is an open-source record collection for common and rare chemical lists using IUPAC as input and SMILES/SMARTS as output. As 
        mostly needed by myself as I search through chemical infinity. 
        
        I have found these lists written in history to be useful, they come from a variety of different fields but are aggregated 
        into the most common format of organic chemists (IUPAC) and the common language of the cheminformatician (SMILES) and for 
        pattern matching (SMARTS).

        Installation 
        ============
        
        GlobalChem is going to be distribute via PyPi and as the content store grows we can expand it to other pieces of software
        making it accessible to all regardless of what you use. Alternatively, you could have a glance at the source code and copy/paste
        it yourself.
        
        ```
        
        pip install global-chem
        
        ```
        Quick Start
        ===========
        
        Just with no dependencies, intialize the class and there you go! All the common and rare groups of the world
        at your disposal 
        
        To Access Nodes and Visualize the Internal Network:
        
        ```python
        
        from global_chem import GlobalChem
        
        gc = GlobalChem()
        
        nodes_list = gc.check_available_nodes()
        print (nodes_list)
        
        >>>
        'emerging_perfluoro_alkyls', 'montmorillonite_adsorption', 'common_monomer_repeating_units', 'electrophilic_warheads_for_kinases',
        
        gc.build_global_chem_network(print_output=True)
        
        >>>
        'global_chem': {
            'children': [
                'environment',
                'miscellaneous',
                'organic_synthesis',
                'medicinal_chemistry',
                'narcotics',
                'interstellar_space',
                'proteins',
                'materials'
            ],
            'name': 'global_chem',
            'node_value': <global_chem.global_chem.Node object at 0x10f60eed0>,
            'parents': []
        },
        ```
        
        Fetch Data from Node:
        
        ```python
        
        gc = GlobalChem()
        gc.build_global_chem_network()
        node = gc.get_node('emerging_perfluoroalkyls.py')
        print (node)
        
        >>>
        {'perfluorohexanoic acid': 'C(=O)(C(C(C(C(C(F)(F)F)(F)F)(F)F)(F)F)(F)F)O' etc...}
        ```
        
        To Create Your Own Chemical Graph Network And Check the Values
        
        ```python
        
        from global_chem import GlobalChem
        
        gc = GlobalChem(verbose=False)
        gc.initiate_network()
        gc.add_node('global_chem', 'common_monomer_repeating_units')
        gc.add_node('common_monomer_repeating_units','electrophilic_warheads_for_kinases')
        values = gc.get_node_smiles('common_monomer_repeating_units')
        
        print (values)
        
        >>>
        '3′-bromo-2-chloro[1,1′:4′,1′′-terphenyl]-4,4′′': 'ClC1=CC=CC=C1C2=CC=C(C3=CC=CC=C3)C(Br)=C2'
        
        values = gc.get_node_smarts('electrophilic_warheads_for_kinases')
        
        >>>
        'propane-1,3-diyl': '[#6]-[#6]-[#6]', 'methylmethylene': '[#6H]-[#6]',
        
        ```

        GlobalChem, initially, is one class object with a series of Nodes that are act as objects for any common chemical lists. 
        The chemical lists can be accessed as nodes and the user can construct their own node trees for the lists.
        
        Also since these lists of commonality are stored on github it is easily searchable and tied directly to the paper for 
        any bypasser.

        GlobalChem was created because I noticed I was using the same variable across multiple scripts and figure it would be useful
        for folk to have.
