## Functions

### Function: plot_importance()

<div align="center">

	src="https://github.com/DrJohnWagner/PDSUtilities/blob/5f98150552fbf9f985546906ecec1bebb5a91257/images/plot_importance.png?raw=true"

	/>
</div>

The `plot_importance()` function is a plotly-based replacement
for `xgboost.plot_importance()`. The APIs are similar (though
several parameters have been renamed) but with two key differences.
First, `PDSUtilities.xgboost.plot_importance()` does not rely on `fmap`
to supply feature names, instead exposing a `labels` parameter that
that can either be a `list` of labels or a `dict` that allows mapping of
feature names to labels.

And second, `PDSUtilities.xgboost.plot_importance()` does not rely on `matplotlib`
at all, instead using `plotly` for visualisation. This produces
an interactive, publication-quality visualisation that can also
be customised more easily, particularly using `plotly.io` templates.

**The `PDSUtilities.xgboost.plot_importance()` function is a direct
copy/paste/edit modification of `xgboost.plot_importance()` with a few
minor tweaks to the API and relatively light changes to the code. The
xgboost team deserves the vast majority of credit for this code!**
The xgboost license can be found here:
https://github.com/dmlc/xgboost/blob/master/LICENSE

The API is:
```
plot_importance(
	booster, labels = {}, width = 0.6, xrange = None, yrange = None,
	title = 'Feature Importance', xlabel = 'F Score', ylabel = 'Features',
	fmap = '', max_features = None, importance_type = 'weight',
	show_grid = True, show_values = True)
```

**Example Usage**
```
import pandas as pd

from xgboost import XGBClassifier
from xgboost import XGBModel
from xgboost import Booster

from sklearn.compose import ColumnTransformer
from sklearn.feature_selection import chi2
from sklearn.feature_selection import SelectKBest
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
from sklearn.pipeline import Pipeline
from sklearn.preprocessing import OrdinalEncoder
from sklearn.preprocessing import MinMaxScaler

from PDSUtilities.xgboost import plot_importance

[...]

df = pd.read_csv("/some/datafile.csv")

xt, xv, yt, yv = train_test_split(
	df.drop("OutputFeature", axis = 1),
	df["OutputFeature"],
)

pipeline = Pipeline(steps = [
    ("transform", ColumnTransformer(
            transformers = [
                ("cat", OrdinalEncoder(), categorical_columns),
                ("num", MinMaxScaler(), numerical_columns)
            ]
        )
    ),
    ("features", SelectKBest()),
    ("classifier", XGBClassifier(
            objective = "binary:logistic",
			eval_metric = "auc",
			use_label_encoder = False
        )
    )
])

parameters = {
    "classifier__colsample_bytree": 0.2,
    "classifier__gamma": 0.4,
    "classifier__learning_rate": 0.1,
    "classifier__max_depth": 4,
    "classifier__n_estimators": 60,
    "features__k": 10,
    "features__score_func": chi2
}
pipeline.set_params(**parameters)
model = pipeline.fit(xt, yt)

[...]

classifier = pipeline["classifier"]
labels = [feature for column in xt.columns]

fig = plot_importance(classifier, labels = labels)
fig.update_layout(template = "presentation", width = 700, height = 600)
fig.show()
```

### Function: plot_tree()

<div align="center">
	<img
	src="https://github.com/DrJohnWagner/PDSUtilities/blob/5f98150552fbf9f985546906ecec1bebb5a91257/images/plot_tree_colour.png?raw=true"
	alt="plot_tree_colour" style="width:700px;"
	/>
</div>

The `plot_tree()` function is a plotly-based replacement for `xgboost.plot_tree()`
that takes visualising booster trees to a whole new visual level. As a result,
the API looks nothing like that of `xgboost.plot_tree()`, though in its
simplest usage, it is almost identical, though again not requiring `fmap`
for adding feature names to the visualisation:
```
from PDSUtilities.xgboost import plot_tree

[...]

booster = pipeline["classifier"].get_booster()

fig = plot_tree(booster, tree = 0, labels = labels)
fig.show()
```
In this example, `tree` is the tree number and, as with `plot_importance()`,
the `labels` parameter can be either a `list` or a `dict`.

Note that the default colours were chosen from a vibrant, colourblind-friendly
palette, but can be completely configured via a number of additional configuration
settings. An additional, handy parameter is `grayscale = True`, which produces
a also colorblind-friendly, grayscale visualisation.

<div align="center">
	<img
	src="https://github.com/DrJohnWagner/PDSUtilities/blob/5f98150552fbf9f985546906ecec1bebb5a91257/images/plot_tree_grayscale.png?raw=true"
	alt="plot_tree_grayscale" style="width:700px;"
	/>
</div>

Finally, the `Figure` object returned by `plot_impotance()` can be further customised
via plotly's extensive API.

The `plot_tree()` API is:
```
plot_tree(booster, tree, labels = {}, width = None, height = None,
    precision = 4, scale = 0.7, font = None, grayscale = False,
    node_shape = {}, node_line = {}, node_font = {},
    leaf_shape = {}, leaf_line = {}, leaf_font = {},
    edge_labels = {}, edge_colors = {}, edge_arrow = {},
    edge_line = {}, edge_label = {}, edge_font = {})

```

**Example**
The overall font can be configured by any of the following settings:
```
font = {
	'family': "Garamond, Cambria, Arial, etc",
	'size': 16,
	'color': "#000000"
}
```
These settings can be overridden for nodes, leaves and edges by the
`node_font`, `leaf_font` and `edge_font` settings, respectively. For
example, specifying
```
edge_font = {
	'size': 11,
}
```
would override the `font` setting so that the edge labels would be
11pt Garamond.

Edge colours can be configured via a decision-specific `dict`. For
example, the edge colours corresponding to `grayscale = True`
could be set by:
```
edge_clours = {
	'Yes': "#222222",
	'No': "#777777",
	'Missing': "#AAAAAA",
	'Yes/Missing':  "#222222",
	'No/Missing': "#777777",
}
```
Note that the keys `Yes/Missing` and `No/Missing` correspond to
the case where a branch point has a `Missing` branch that connects
to the same child as `Yes` or `No`, respectively.

Similarly, the edge labels can also be configured via a decision-specific
`dict`. The default is:
```
edge_labels = {
	'Yes': "Yes",
	'No': "No",
	'Missing': "Missing",
	'Yes/Missing': "Yes/Missing",
	'No/Missing': "No/Missing"
}
```
This is handy, for example, when it is known *a priori* that there are
no missing values, in which case setting
```
edge_labels = {
	'Yes/Missing': "Yes/Missing",
	'No/Missing': "No/Missing"
}
```
will lead to a much cleaner looking visualisation.

Node and leaf shapes and lines can also be configured:
```
 node_shape = {
	'type': "rect",
	'fillcolor': "#CBCBCB",
	'opacity': 1.0,
}
node_line = {
	'color': "#666666",
	'width': 1,
	'dash': "solid",
}
leaf_shape = {
	'type': "rounded",
	'fillcolor': "#EDEDED",
	'opacity': 1.0,
}
leaf_line = {
	'color': "#777777",
	'width': 1,
	'dash': "solid",
}
```
Note that `type` can be any of `"rect"`, `"circle"` or
`"rounded"` and that `dash` can be any of `"solid"`, `"dot"`, `"dash"`, `"longdash"`,
`"dashdot"` or `"longdashdot"`.

The edge line, arrow and label properties can also be configured:
```
edge_line = {
	'width': 1.5,
	'dash': "solid",
}
edge_arrow = {
	'arrowhead': 3, # Integer between or equal to 0 and 8
	'arrowsize': 1.5,
}
edge_label = {
	'align': "center",
	'bgcolor': "#FFFFFF",
	'bordercolor': "rgba(0,0,0,0)",
	'borderpad': 1,
	'borderwidth': 1,
	'opacity': 1.0,
	'textangle': 0,
	'valign': "middle",
	'visible': True,
}
```
where `dash` is as above and `arrowhead` is an `int` in `range(0, 9)`
that specifies the arrowhead style.

Additionally, `plot_tree()` accepts `width` and `height` parameters
specifying the overall width and height of the visualisation--though the defaults
are reasonably good and tree-size dependent--as well as a `precision` parameter
specifying the number of decimal places displayed when rendering the numbers
in nodes and leaves.

Finally, `plot_tree()` also accepts a `scale` parameter that can be adjusted up or
down if the node and/or leaf labels do not quite fit in their corresponding
shapes. This can occur because `plot_tree()` does not use font metrics for
computing the size of the labels, instead using a reasonable guess. This is
because plotly does not offer this via their API and no python font metric
libraries seemed to offer what was needed. This may be improved in the future
but for now, adjusting `scale` is the preferred method for dealing with this.

As with `plot_impotance()` the returned `Figure` object can be further customised
via plotly's extensive API.

### Function: plot_histograms()

The `plot_histograms()` function uses plotly to produce publication-quality histograms
for all categorical and numerical columns in a `pandas` dataframe with a single line of code.
In its simplest usage, `plot_histograms()` takes a single argument--the dataframe--but with
only a few more arguments, it quickly becomes a tool for not only visualising your data, but
also for exploriing it. For example, this code,
```
import pandas as pd
from PDSUtilities.pandas import plot_histograms

df = pd.read_csv("./data/heart.csv")

fig = plot_histograms(df, target = "ChestPainType", template = "presentation",
	title = "Heart Disease Dataset Histograms Grouped by Chest Pain Type")
fig.show()
```
produces histograms grouped by the values in the `target` column:
<div align="center">
	<img
	src="https://github.com/DrJohnWagner/PDSUtilities/blob/2effc8d9e49e65bd5a83d2d0dc315e71a26c1a86/images/plot_histograms.png?raw=true"
	alt="plot_histograms" style="width:700px;"
	/>
</div>

The `plot_histograms()` function has the following API:
```
plot_histograms(df, target = None, columns = None, rows = None, cols = None, width = None, height = None,
    title = None, cumulative = None, barmode = "stack", opacity = 0.65, bins = 0,
	hovermode = None, template = None, colors = 0, font = {}, title_font = {}, legend_font = {})
```

If `target = None` then totals are plotted for every column in the dataframe. If instead, `target`
is the name of a column, then totals for each value of the `target` are plotted for every column.

If `columns = None` then all columns are plotted. Otherwise, only the columns in `columns` are plotted.

If either or both of the number of `rows` and `cols` are specified, those are used in arranging the
histograms in the grid. Otherwise values are chosen automatically in a reasonable manner. The same
applies tohe `width` and `column`: either or both can be specified and missing values are calculated
automatically based upon the specified or calculated `rows` and `cols`.

The `title` can be supplied either as a string or a `dict` according to the plotly specification.
As an example, the default `dict` that is created when `title` is a string is:
```
title = { 'text': title, 'x': 0.5, 'xanchor': "center" }
```

Specifying `cumulative = True` produces cumulative histograms for each `target` variable, or the entire
dataset if `target = None`.

The `barmode` argument can be any of `"stack"`, `"group"` or `"overlay"`, and `opacity` is used only
when `barmode` is `"overlay"` to specify the opacity of the bars.

The `bins` argument can be either an `int` or a `dict` and suggests a maximum number of bins to use
for numerical columns. When `bins` is an `int`, this argument applies to all columns in the dataframe.
Note that the default value, `bins = 0`, specifies that plotly should choose the value automatically.
When `bins` is a `dict` it specifies the maximum number of bins for those columns in the dictionary,
where keys are column names and values are bins.

The `hovermode` argument controls the hover text and markers displayed as the cursor hovers over values
in plotly plots and can be any of `"x"`, `"y"`, `"x unified"` or `"y unified"`, with the same meaning
as in plotly. The default is `"x unified"`which causes all values corresponding to the current x position
to be displayed in a single hover textbox.

The `template` argument can be used to specify a plotly template. See https://plotly.com/python/templates/
and the plotly documentation.

The `colors` argument can be an `int` in `range(-1, 5)` or a string from the list
`["Vibrant", "Bright", "Muted", "Medium-Contrast", "Grayscale"]`specifying one of
five colourblindness-friendly schemes to be used in setting the bar colours; or it
can be a list of colour strings of the form `"#RRGGBB"`, `"rgb(255,255,255)"` or
`"rgba(255,255,255,1.0)"` to be used instead of the colour schemes.
Note that all of the colour schemes are colour blindness friendly and have significant
contrast. This is also true of the grayscale colour scheme, which can be selected with
either `colors = 4` or `colors = -1`.

The `font`, `title_font` and `legend_font` set the fonts used for the text elements in the plots and
take values similar to other `PDSUtilities` functions. For example, the default font is:
```
font = {
	'family': "Verdana, Helvetica, Verdana, Calibri, Garamond, Cambria, Arial",
	'size': 14,
	'color': "#000000"
}
```
