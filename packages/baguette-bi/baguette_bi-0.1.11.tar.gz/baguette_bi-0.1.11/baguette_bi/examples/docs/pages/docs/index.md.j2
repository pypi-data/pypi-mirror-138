# Baguette BI documentation

Baguette BI is a Python Business Intelligence framework. It allows data teams to define
their main deliverable with Python and Markdown, thus making it version-controlled,
easily reviewable, testable and reproducible.

To dive straight in, read the {{ "Tutorial" | link("docs/tutorial/index") }}.

For a set of problems that this framework tries to solve and what it does differently
than other BI tools, see {{ "Motivation" | link("motivation") }}.

For a non-exhaustive list of what can be done in Baguette, consult with
{{ "Reference" | link("docs/reference") }}.


## Install and run it yourself

To run the docs on your local machine, first install Baguette with `pip`:

`$ pip install baguette_bi`

And then run the docs command:

`$ baguette docs`


## Acknowledgements

Baguette BI wouldn't exist without Artemiy [@s1yrat](https://github.com/s1yrat) and his
insightful feedback, ideas and, of course, code contributions.

The credit for the original idea that BI should look like a set of hyperlinked pages,
not dashboards, goes to Adam [@mcrascal](https://github.com/mcrascal). Check out his project,
[Evidence](https://www.evidence.dev/), which is similar, but also different, and has much
better design ðŸ˜….
