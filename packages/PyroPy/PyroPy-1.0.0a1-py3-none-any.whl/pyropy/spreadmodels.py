"""spreadmodels.py

Australian rate of spread models for wildfire and prescribed burns.

Unless otherwise indicated all models have been taken from:

> Cruz, Miguel, James Gould, Martin Alexander, Lachie Mccaw, and Stuart Matthews. 
(2015) A Guide to Rate of Fire Spread Models for Australian Vegetation, 
CSIRO Land & Water and AFAC, Melbourne, Vic 125 pp. 

Unless otherwise indicated all equations numbers also refer to Cruz et al. 2015.

All spread models take a pandas weather dataframe and model specific 
parmeters as arguments.

The weather dataframe must include the following exact fields (column headings):
```
    date_time: a pandas datetime field
    temp: Air temerature (°C)
    humidity: Relative humidity (%)
    wind_speed: 10 m wind speed (km/h)
    wind_dir: Wind direction (°)
```
Ideally the weather dataframe should include a drought factor though this
can be added as a parameter. TODO add error checking for this!

The `weather` module provides function for reading `*.csv` files into 
dataframes from standard sources
