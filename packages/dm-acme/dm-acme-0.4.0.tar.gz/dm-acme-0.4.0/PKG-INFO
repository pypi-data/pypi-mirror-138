Acme is a library of reinforcement learning (RL) agents
and agent building blocks. Acme strives to expose simple, efficient,
and readable agents, that serve both as reference implementations of popular
algorithms and as strong baselines, while still providing enough flexibility
to do novel research. The design of Acme also attempts to provide multiple
points of entry to the RL problem at differing levels of complexity.
