## Description

![](https://github.com/diningphil/PyDGN/blob/master/images/pydgn-logo.png)
This is a Python library to easily experiment
with [Deep Graph Networks](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0893608020302197) (DGNs). It provides
automatic management of data splitting, loading and the most common experimental settings. It also handles both model
selection and risk assessment procedures, by trying many different configurations in parallel (CPU or GPU). This
repository is built upon the [Pytorch Geometric Library](https://pytorch-geometric.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) and [Pytorch Geometric Temporal](https://pytorch-geometric-temporal.readthedocs.io/en/latest/modules/root.html), which
provide support for data management.

If you happen to use or modify this code, please remember to cite our tutorial paper:

[Bacciu Davide, Errica Federico, Micheli Alessio, Podda Marco: *A Gentle Introduction to Deep Learning for
Graphs*](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0893608020302197), Neural Networks, 2020.
DOI: `10.1016/j.neunet.2020.06.006`.

Representations (ICLR 2020).* [Code](https://github.com/diningphil/gnn-comparison)

## What's New
With PyDGN 0.7.0, we have released the first support for temporal experiments! In particular, we can now tackle node prediction in single graph sequence tasks!
We rely on [Pytorch Geometric Temporal](https://pytorch-geometric-temporal.readthedocs.io/en/latest/modules/root.html) for the definition of data and models.

## Installation:

(We assume **git** and **Miniconda/Anaconda** are installed)

First, make sure gcc 5.2.0 is installed: ``conda install -c anaconda libgcc=5.2.0``. Then, ``echo $LD_LIBRARY_PATH``
should always contain ``:/home/[your user name]/miniconda3/lib``. Then run from your terminal the following command:

    source setup/install.sh [<your_cuda_version>]
    pip install pydgn

Where `<your_cuda_version>` is an optional argument that can be either `cpu`, `cu102` or `cu111` for Pytorch >= 1.8.0.
If you do not provide a cuda version, the script will default to `cpu`. The script will create a virtual environment
named `pydgn`, with all the required packages needed to run our code. **Important:** do NOT run this command
using `bash` instead of `source`!

Remember
that [PyTorch MacOS Binaries dont support CUDA, install from source if CUDA is needed](https://pytorch.org/get-started/locally/)

## Usage:

### Preprocess your dataset (see also Wiki)

    python build_dataset.py --config-file [your data config file]

#### Exampla

    python build_dataset.py --config-file DATA_CONFIGS/config_PROTEINS.yml 

### Launch an experiment in debug mode (see also Wiki)

    python launch_experiment.py --config-file [your exp. config file] --splits-folder [the splits MAIN folder] --data-splits [the splits file] --data-root [root folder of your data] --dataset-name [name of the dataset] --dataset-class [class that handles the dataset] --max-cpus [max cpu parallelism] --max-gpus [max gpu parallelism] --gpus-per-task [how many gpus to allocate for each job] --final-training-runs [how many final runs when evaluating on test. Results are averaged] --result-folder [folder where to store results]

#### Example (GPU required)

    python launch_experiment.py --config-file MODEL_CONFIGS/config_SupToyDGN_RandomSearch.yml --splits-folder DATA_SPLITS/CHEMICAL/ --data-splits DATA_SPLITS/CHEMICAL/PROTEINS/PROTEINS_outer10_inner1.splits --data-root DATA --dataset-name PROTEINS --dataset-class pydgn.data.dataset.TUDatasetInterface --max-cpus 1 --max-gpus 1 --final-training-runs 1 --result-folder RESULTS/DEBUG

To debug your code it is useful to add `--debug` to the command above. Notice, however, that the CLI will not work as
expected here, as code will be executed sequentially. After debugging, if you need sequential execution, you can
use `--max-cpus 1 --max-gpus 1 --gpus-per-task [0/1]` without the `--debug` option.

#### Grid Search 101

Have a look at one of the config files.

#### Random Search 101

Specify a `num_samples` in the config file with the number of random trials, replace `grid`
with `random`, and specify a sampling method for each hyper-parameter. We provide different sampling methods:

- choice --> pick at random from a list of arguments
- uniform --> pick uniformly from min and max arguments
- normal --> sample from normal distribution with mean and std
- randint --> pick at random from min and max
- loguniform --> pick following the recprocal distribution from log_min, log_max, with a specified base

There is one config file, namely `config_SupToyDGN_RandomSearch.yml`, which you can check to see an example.

## Data Splits

We provide the data splits taken from

[Errica Federico, Podda Marco, Bacciu Davide, Micheli Alessio: *A Fair Comparison of Graph Neural Networks for Graph
Classification*](https://openreview.net/pdf?id=HygDF6NFPB). *Proceedings of the 8th International Conference on Learning
Representations (ICLR 2020).* [Code](https://github.com/diningphil/gnn-comparison)

in the `DATA_SPLITS` folder.

## Credits:

This is a joint project with **Marco Podda** ([Github](https://github.com/marcopodda)
/[Homepage](https://sites.google.com/view/marcopodda/home)), whom I thank for his relentless dedication.

Many thanks to **Antonio Carta** ([Github](https://github.com/AntonioCarta) /[Homepage](http://pages.di.unipi.it/carta))
for incorporating the Ray library (see v0.4.0) into PyDGN! This will be of tremendous help.

Many thanks to **Danilo Numeroso** ([Github](https://github.com/danilonumeroso)
/[Homepage](https://pages.di.unipi.it/numeroso/)) for implementing a very flexible random search! This is a very
convenient alternative to grid search.

Many thanks to **Alessio Gravina** ([Github](https://github.com/gravins)
/[Homepage](http://pages.di.unipi.it/gravina/)) for his invaluable help and expertise regarding the implementation of PyDGN temporal. We still have a lot of work to do!

## Troubleshooting

As of 15th of August 2021, there is
an [issue](https://discuss.pytorch.org/t/warning-leaking-caffe2-thread-pool-after-fork-function-pthreadpool/127559/2)
with Pytorch 1.9.0 which impacts the CLI. This is why the setup script installs Pytorch 1.8.1 in the `pydgn` conda
environment until Pytorch 1.10 is released (known to solve the issue).

If you get errors like ``/lib64/libstdc++.so.6: version `GLIBCXX_3.4.21' not found``:

* make sure gcc 5.2.0 is installed: ``conda install -c anaconda libgcc=5.2.0``
* ``echo $LD_LIBRARY_PATH`` should contain ``:/home/[your user name]/[your anaconda or miniconda folder name]/lib``
* after checking the above points, you can reinstall everything with pip using the ``--no-cache-dir`` option
