# Equation-Solver

This is a project that solves mathematic equations for you!

Types:

1. Quadratic
    - ***eqsolvcarlover101.quadsolve()***
      > To type a square in python, you need to use a carrot **^** or two astrix **. (Ex. 2x^2 -5x +4)

2. Slope Intercept
    - ***eqsolvcarlover101.slopeint()***
      > Put in two points, and output an equation in slope-intercept form.

Types in Development (Not included in the package, but will probably be on github.):

1. Perpendicular Lines
    - ***eqsolvcarlover101.perpint()***
      > Put in the slope of a line, and the intersection point, and get the slope-intercept equation of the perpendicular line.

2. Midpoint
    - ***eqsolvcarlover101.midpoint()***
      >
