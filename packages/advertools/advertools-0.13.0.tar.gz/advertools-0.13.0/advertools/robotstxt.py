ðŸ¤– Analyze and Test robots.txt Files on a Large Scale
=====================================================

Even though they are tiny in size, robots.txt files contain potent instructions
that can block major sections of your site, which is what they are supposed to
do. Only sometimes you might make the mistake of blocking the wrong section.

So it is very important to check if certain pages (or groups of pages) are
blocked for a certain user-agent by a certain robots.txt file. Ideally, you
would want to run the same check for all possible user-agents. Even more
ideally, you want to be able to run the check for a large number of pages with
every possible combination with user-agents!

To get the robots.txt file into an easily readable format, you can use the
:func:`robotstxt_to_df` function to get it in a DataFrame.

The returned DataFrame contains columns for directives, their content, the URL
of the robots.txt file, as well as the date it was downloaded.

*  `directive`: The main commands. Allow, Disallow, Sitemap, Crawl-delay,
   User-agent, and so on.
*  `content`: The details of each of the directives
*  `robotstxt_last_modified`: The date when the robots.txt file was last
   modified, if provided.
*  `etag`: The entity tag of the response header, if provided.
*  `robotstxt_url`: The URL of the robots.txt file.
*  `download_date`: The date and time when the file was downloaded.

Alternatively, you can provide a list of robots URLs if you want to download
them all in one go. This might be interesting if:

* You are analyzing an industry and want to keep an eye on many different
  websites.
* You are analyzing a website with many sub-domains, and want to get all the
  robots files together.
* You are trying to understand a company that has many websites under
  different domains and sub-domains.

In this case you simply provide a list of URLs instead of a single one.

An optional parameter ``output_file`` is also available in case you are
requesting hundreds of files. The supported format is `.jl`. This saves the
downloaded files by appending them to the file, so it is also useful if you
think the process is going to take long and might loose your connection for
example.

>>> robotstxt_to_df(['https://example.com/robots.txt',
...                  'https://community.example.com/robots.txt',
...                  'https://shop.example.com/robots.txt'],
...                   output_file='example_robots.jl')

As for testing, the :func:`robotstxt_test` function runs a test for a given
robots.txt file, checking which of the provided user-agents can fetch which of
the provided URLs, paths, or patterns.

>>> robotstxt_test('https://www.example.com/robots.txt',
...                useragents=['Googlebot', 'baiduspider', 'Bingbot']
...                urls=['/', '/hello', '/some-page.html']])

As a result, you get a DataFrame with a row for each combination of
(user-agent, URL) indicating whether or not that particular user-agent can
fetch the given URL.

Some reasons why you might want to do that:

* SEO Audits: Especially for large websites with many URL patterns, and many
  rules for different user-agents.
* Developer or site owner about to make large changes
* Interest in strategies of certain companies

User-agents
-----------

In reality there are only two groups of user-agents that you need to worry
about:

* User-agents listed in the robots.txt file: For each one of those you need to
  check whether or not they are blocked from fetching a certain URL
  (or pattern).
* ``*`` all other user-agents: The ``*`` includes all other user-agents, so
  checking the rules that apply to it should take care of the rest.

robots.txt Testing Approach
---------------------------

1. Get the robots.txt file that you are interested in
2. Extract the user-agents from it
3. Specify the URLs you are interested in testing
4. Run the :func:`robotstxt_test` function

[484 rows x 4 columns]

Now that we have downloaded the file, we can easily extract the list of
user-agents that it contains.

>>> fb_useragents = (fb_robots
...                  [fb_robots['directive']=='User-agent']
...                  ['content'].drop_duplicates()
...                  .tolist())
>>> fb_useragents
['Applebot',
 'baiduspider',
 'Bingbot',
 'Discordbot',
 'facebookexternalhit',
 'Googlebot',
 'Googlebot-Image',
 'ia_archiver',
 'LinkedInBot',
 'msnbot',
 'Naverbot',
 'Pinterestbot',
 'seznambot',
 'Slurp',
 'teoma',
 'TelegramBot',
 'Twitterbot',
 'Yandex',
 'Yeti',
 '*']


Quite a long list!

As a small and quick test, I'm interested in checking the home page, a random
profile page (/bbc), groups and hashtags pages.

>>> urls_to_test = ['/', '/bbc', '/groups', '/hashtag/']
>>> fb_test = robotstxt_test('https://www.facebook.com/robots.txt',
...                          fb_useragents, urls_to_test)
>>> fb_test
                          robotstxt_url user_agent   url_path  can_fetch
0   https://www.facebook.com/robots.txt          *       /bbc      False
1   https://www.facebook.com/robots.txt          *    /groups      False
2   https://www.facebook.com/robots.txt          *          /      False
3   https://www.facebook.com/robots.txt          *  /hashtag/      False
4   https://www.facebook.com/robots.txt   Applebot          /       True
..                                  ...        ...        ...        ...

79  https://www.facebook.com/robots.txt      teoma    /groups       True
[80 rows x 4 columns]


For twenty user-agents and four URLs each, we received a total of eighty test
results. You can immediately see that all user-agents not listed (denoted by
`*` are not allowed to fetch any of the provided URLs).

Let's see who is and who is not allowed to fetch the home page.

>>> fb_test.query('url_path== "/"')
                          robotstxt_url           user_agent  url_path  can_fetch

76  https://www.facebook.com/robots.txt                teoma         /       True

I'll leave it to you to figure out why LinkedIn and Pinterest are not allowed
to crawl the home page but Google and Apple are, because I have no clue!

    For research purposes and if you want to download more than ~500 files, you
    might want to use ``output_file`` to save results as they are downloaded.
    The file extension should be ".jl", and robots files are appended to that
    file as soon as they are downloaded, in case you lose your connection, or
    maybe your patience!
