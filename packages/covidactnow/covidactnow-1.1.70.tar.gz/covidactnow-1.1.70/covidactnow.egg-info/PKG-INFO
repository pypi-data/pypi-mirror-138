Description: # Covid Act Now Database Wrapper
        
        This package is an extremely bare-bones wrapper around Covid Act Now's database of COVID-19 related information. View the PyPi project [here](https://pypi.org/project/covidactnow/), and the original post page [here](https://covidinfo.preritdas.com). 
        
        Usage is simple. Install the package with `pip install covidactnow`.
        
        Instantiate a user object with your API key as an argument. You can easily generate an API key [here](https://covidactnow.org/data-api).
        
        ```python
        import covidactnow
        
        api = covidactnow.User(api_key = 'yourapikey')
        
        washingtonInfectionRate = api.infRate('WA')
        massachussettsVaxRate = api.vaxRate('MA')
        
        print(f"{washingtonInfectionRate = }")
        print(f"{massachussettsVaxRate = }")
        ```
        This will result (with different data, of course):
        ```
        washingtonInfectionRate = 1.16
        massachussettsVaxRate = 76.3
        ```

        For more information on how the wrapper works, particularly how it was redesigned to be package-friendly, read the "Updated for Distribution" section of this [page](https://covidinfo.preritdas.com). Note that this version has been updated to get data from within a `User` class allowing individual API keys to be used (as opposed to defining a state as an object and defining statistics as object attributes).
