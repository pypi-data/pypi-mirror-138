Notes
-----
It would be best if you import this project as ``Py3C``.
(``import Py3Challenges as Py3C``)

Getting Started
---------------
First you have to get your challenge.
Go get them you can use ``Py3C.get_challenge(name_o_id)``
where ``name_o_id`` is the name of the challenge or the
numeric id (in the order in which the where loaded).

Then you can use following code-structure to make the
challenges:

>>> import Py3Challenges as Py3C
... challenge = Py3C.get_challenge(0)  # the "print"-challenge
... with challenge:
...     # do whatever you want inside here to complete the challenge
...     pass

If you need help while making a challenge you should use
the ``.get_help()``-method.

Example:
>>> import Py3Challenges as Py3C
... challenge = Py3C.get_challenge(1)  # the "addition"-challenge
... challenge.what_values()

Sometimes the challenges also provides the argument
``values`` which is an instance of ``dict``.

To get information about what values are present and
which types they have, use the ``.what_values()``-method.

Example:
>>> import Py3Challenges as Py3C
... challenge = Py3C.get_challenge(1)  # the "addition"-challenge
... challenge.what_values()

They can be accessed using ``values["key"]``.
A short example on a challange:

>>> import Py3Challenges as Py3C
... challenge = Py3C.get_challenge(1)  # the "addition"-challenge
... x = challenge.values["x"]
... y = challenge.values["y"]
... with challenge:
...     # do whatever you want inside here to complete the challenge
...     pass

Getting Help
------------
You should try the method ``challenge.get_help()``. If this
doesn't help you feel free to open an issue over on GitHub
(https://github.com/AlbertUnruh/Py3Challenges/issues).
