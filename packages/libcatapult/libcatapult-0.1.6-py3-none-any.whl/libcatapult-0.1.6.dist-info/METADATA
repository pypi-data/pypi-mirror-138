# LibCatapult

This library is a place to put all the useful tools and functions the Satellite Applications Catapult develop so they can be easily reused.

Please try to keep the structure sensible. Add anything you need to use in more than one project here.

This must run against python 3.5+ No support for 2.7 is planned or expected.
