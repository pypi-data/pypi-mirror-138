=======
MovData
=======

MovData is a Python library that provides tools for analysing movement data within the
fields of ecology and conservation.

**Note**: MovData is a very young package. While the available tools should
be stable and working correctly, it's still possible this API functions may change in upcoming
releases. But we would love for you to try it out, give feedback or contribute!


What is a Relocations?
----------------------
Relocations is a model for a set of fixes from a given subject.
Because fixes are temporal, they can be ordered asc or desc. The additional_data dict can contain info
specific to the subject and relocations: name, type, region, sex etc. These values are applicable to all
fixes in the relocations array. If they vary, then they should be put into each fix's additional_data dict.


Examples
--------

quickly create a geometry point

.. code:: python

  >>> import movdata
  >>> geopoint = movdata.geopoint(x=1, y=1, crs=4326)
  >>> geopoint.shapely_geometry

      POINT Z (1 2 0)

  >>> geopoint.to_crs(crs=3857)

      POINT Z (111319.4907932736 222684.2085055441 0)

Earth Engine Authentication
---------------------------
EE needs to be authenticated before using the eetools module in pymet. Here's how to authenticate:

* Run the command 'earthengine authenticate' from a cmd window/shell which will provide a url to paste into a browser with the sign in page for your Google accounts. Choose the account whitelisted for earth engine
* You will be given a code that should be pasted into the terminal
* An authentication token will be stored locally indefinitely
