    Attributes:
        model_space:
            The model space.
        calibrated_models:
            Calibrated models. Will be used to augment the model selection problem (e.g.
            by excluding them from the model space).
        compare:
            A method that compares models by selection criterion.
        criterion:
            The criterion used to compare models.
        method:
            The method used to search the model space.
        version:
            The version of the PEtab Select format.
        yaml_path:
            The location of the selection problem YAML file. Used for relative
            paths that exist in e.g. the model space files.
            TODO should the relative paths be relative to the YAML or the
            file that contains them?

    Unsaved attributes:
        candidate_space:
            The candidate space that will be used.

                Essentially reproducible from `Problem.method` and
