leetscraper is a web scraper for leetcode and other coding challenge websites!  
It was created as a way to gather coding problems to solve without having to sign up to a website or submit code to a problem checker.

***
 
# Usage
  
### Install package and dependencies
```python
pip install leetscraper tqdm urllib3 beautifulsoup4 selenium webdriver-manager
```

### Examples

Import the module and Instantiate the class. The class has some kwargs options to control the behaviour of the scraper.
However, all the default values will start to scrape all problems from [leetcode.com](https://leetcode.com "leetcode website") to the cwd.
  
The most basic usage looks like this:
```python
from leetscraper import Leetscraper

if __name__ == "__main__":
    Leetscraper()
```
  
The avaliable kwargs to control the behaviour of the scraper are:
```python
"""
website_name: "leetcode.com", "projecteuler.net", "codechef.com" ("leetcode.com" is set if ignored)
scraped_path: "path/to/save/scraped_problems" (Current working directory is set if ignored)
scrape_limit: Integer of how many problems to scrape at a time (-1 is set if ignored, which is no limit)
auto_scrape: "True", "False" (True is set if ignored)
"""
```
  
Example of how to automatically scrape the first 50 problems from [projecteuler.net](https://projecteuler.net "project euler website") to a directory called SOLVE-ME:
```python
from leetscraper import Leetscraper

if __name__ == "__main__":
    Leetscraper(website_name="projecteuler.net", scraped_path="~/SOLVE-ME", scrape_limit=50)
```
  
Example of how to scrape all problems from all supported websites:
```python
from leetscraper import Leetscraper

if __name__ == "__main__":
    websites = ["leetcode.com", "projecteuler.net", "codechef.com"]

    for site in websites:
        Leetscraper(website_name=site)
```
  
You can pass through different arguments for different websites to control exactly how the scraper behaves.
You can also disable scraping problems at time of instantiation by using the kwarg `auto_scrape=False`.
This allows you to call the class functions in different order, or one at a time.
This will change how the scraper works, as its designed to look in a directory for already scraped problems to avoid duplicates.
I would encourage you to look at the function docstrings if you wish to use this scraper outside of its intended automated use.
