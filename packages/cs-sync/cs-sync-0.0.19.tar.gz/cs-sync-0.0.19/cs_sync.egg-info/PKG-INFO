# Descriptions

A custom syncing tool. Originally used to simply tasks such as checking on my local Git repositories and syncing to my Taskwarrior server. May someday add S3 support.

## Current Support

* Git
* Taskwarrior

# Usage

Uses async operations, alongside package such as Click (what Typer is built upon) and blessed to create a pleasant experience checking on your local repos and syncing your tasks with your Taskwarrior server.

The default is to check your config file, located at `~/.cssync`, and load up your configuration details. If this is not the case, then it will use reasonable defaults for your local configuration.
