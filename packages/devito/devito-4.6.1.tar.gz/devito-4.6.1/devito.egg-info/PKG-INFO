Devito is a new tool for performing
      optimised Finite Difference (FD) computation from high-level
      symbolic problem definitions. Devito performs automated code
      generation and Just-In-time (JIT) compilation based on symbolic
      equations defined in SymPy to create and execute highly
      optimised Finite Difference kernels on multiple computer
      platforms.
