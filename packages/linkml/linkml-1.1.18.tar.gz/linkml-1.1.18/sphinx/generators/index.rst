Generators
==========

A LinkML *generator* is code that transforms a linkml schema into a
datamodel expressed using another framework, or into some other
artefact, such as JSON-Schema, or markdown documentation.

Generators allow you to tap into the rich tooling offered in other
technical stacks, and give you flexibility.
