Zest Race Predictor
____________________

Zest Race Predictor (ZRP) allows its users to estimate race and ethnicty based on an individual's name and home address. ZRP improves upon the Bayesian Improved Surname Geocoding (BISG) method developed by RAND Corporation that is used in fair lending analysis at institutions today.  Our intent is to improve the accuracy of fair lending analysis by using more data and better math, and thereby improve our understanding of disparate impact and disparate treatment of protected-status borrowers.  Armed with a better understanding of the disparities that exist in our financial system, we can highlight inequities create a roadmap to improve equity in access to finance.

ZRP leverages modern predictive algorithms (in particular gradient boosting) in combination with block group and tract-level American Community Survey (ACS) data. By locating each address within a block group or census tract, and referencing demographic attributes associated with that granular geolocation, we can provide trained models with data as high fidelity as Census block group.  The predictive features used in the model include such demographic attributes as percentage of residences identifying as a particular race/ethnicity and average houshold income.  Example usage and model training procedures are provided. 


Notes
_____

This is the preliminary version and implementation of the ZRP tool. We're dedicated to continue improving both the algorithm and documentation and hope that government agencies, lenders, citizen data scientists and other interested parties will help us improve the model.


Install
_______

Install requires an internet connection. We recommend installing zrp inside a `python virtual environment <https://docs.python.org/3/library/venv.html#creating-virtual-environments>`_. The package has been tested on 3.7.4, but should likely work with 3.7.X.
::

 pip install zrp

After installing via pip, you need to download the lookup tables using the following command:
::

 python -m zrp download

Note: Due to the size and number of lookup tables necesary for the zrp package, total installation requires 3 GB of available space.


Data
_____

Training Data
==============
The models available in this package were trained on voter registration data from the states of Florida and North Carolina. Summary statistics on these datasets and additional datasets used as validation can be found `here <./dataset_statistics.txt>`_ . 

Consult the following to download state voter registration data:
 * `North Carolina <https://www.ncsbe.gov/results-data/voter-registration-data>`_
 * `Florida <https://dataverse.harvard.edu/dataset.xhtml?persistentId=doi:10.7910/DVN/UBIG3F>`_
 * `Alabama <https://www.alabamainteractive.org/sos/voter/voterWelcome.action>`_
 * `South Carolina <https://www.scvotes.gov/sale-voter-registration-lists>`_
 * `Georgia <https://sos.ga.gov/index.php/elections/order_voter_registration_lists_and_files>`_
 * `Louisiana <https://www.sos.la.gov/ElectionsAndVoting/BecomeACandidate/PurchaseVoterLists/Pages/default.aspx>`_

American Community Survey (ACS) Data:
=====================================

The US Census Bureau details that, "the American Community Survey (ACS) is an ongoing survey that provides data every year -- giving communities the current information they need to plan investments and services. The ACS covers a broad range of topics about social, economic, demographic, and housing characteristics of the U.S. population. The 5-year estimates from the ACS are "period" estimates that represent data collected over a period of time. The primary advantage of using multiyear estimates is the increased statistical reliability of the data for less populated areas and small population subgroups. The 5-year estimates are available for all geographies down to the block group level." ( Bureau, US Census. “American Community Survey 5-Year Data (2009-2019).” Census.gov, 8 Dec. 2021, https://www.census.gov/data/developers/data-sets/acs-5year.html. )

ACS data is available in 1 or 5 year spans. The 5yr ACS data is the most comprehensive & is available at more granular levels than 1yr data. It is thus used in this work.


The Models and API
__________

The ZRP can be broken down into four main segments: preprocessing, geocoding, American Community Survey(ACS) integration, and modeling/predictions.



Usage and Examples
___________

To get started using the ZRP, first ensure the download is complete (as described above) and xgboost == 1.0.2 

Next, check out the guide in the examples folder. Clone the repo in order to obtain the example notebooks and data; this is not provided in the pip installable package.


Validation
__________


The models included in this package were trained on publicly-available voter registration data and validated multiple times: on hold out sets of voter registration data and on a national sample of PPP loan forgiveness data.  The results were consistent across tests:  20-30% more African Americans correctily identified as African American, and 60% fewer whites identified as people of color as compared with the status quo BISG method.  

Performance on the national PPP loan forgiveness dataset was as follows (comparing ZRP softmax with the BISG-80 method):
