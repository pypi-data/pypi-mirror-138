# rcon
An RCON client implementation.
* [Source RCON protocol](https://developer.valvesoftware.com/wiki/Source_RCON_Protocol)
* [BattlEye RCon protocol](https://www.battleye.com/downloads/BERConProtocol.txt)

## Requirements
`rcon` requires Python 3.8 or higher.

## Documentation
Documentation is available on [readthedocs](https://rcon.readthedocs.io/en/latest/).

## Installation
Install rcon from the [AUR](https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/python-rcon/) or via:

    pip install rcon

## Quick start
The `RCON` protocols are used to remotely control game servers, i.e. execute
commands on a game server and receive the respective results.

### Source RCON
```python
from rcon.source import Client

with Client('127.0.0.1', 5000, passwd='mysecretpassword') as client:
    response = client.run('some_command', 'with', 'some', 'arguments')

print(response)
```

#### Async support
If you prefer to use `RCON` in an asynchronous environment, you can use `rcon()`.

```python
from rcon.source import rcon

response = await rcon(
    'some_command', 'with', 'some', 'arguments',
    host='127.0.0.1', port=5000, passwd='mysecretpassword'
)
print(response)
```
