# Marley #

Marley is a framework for multi-agent reinforcement learning. It lets you design a game and run experiments with multiple AI-powered agents playing that game.

**Marley isn't ready for use yet; it works for my research purposes, but I haven't yet made the work needed to make it easy to understand for others.** If you're still interested in using it, feel free to read the code or [email me](mailto:ram@rachum.com) for help.

I hope to make Marley easier to use soon.

**GridRoyale** is a life simulation. It's a case study that's bundled with Marley.

GridRoyale is similar to [Game of Life](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway%27s_Game_of_Life) or
[GridWorld](https://towardsdatascience.com/reinforcement-learning-implement-grid-world-from-scratch-c5963765ebff),
except I added game mechanics to encourage the players to behave socially. These game mechanics are
similar to those in the [battle royale](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_royale_game) genre of
computer games, which is why it's called GridRoyale.


# How to run GridRoyale #

Installation:

```console
$ pip install marley
```

Run the server:

```console
$ marley grid_royale demo
```

This will automatically open a browser window and show you your simulation.
