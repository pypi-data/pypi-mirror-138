Description: Corex featurization and modeling primitives for D3M envrionments
        
        Featurization:
        (featurization with information regularization for continuous data (linear Gaussian model) and text (similar to LDA))
        Corex continuous
        Corex text
        
        Regression:
        (echo provides mutual information regularization: linear regression and neural network modeling primitives provided)
        EchoLinear 
        EchoRegression
        EchoClassification
