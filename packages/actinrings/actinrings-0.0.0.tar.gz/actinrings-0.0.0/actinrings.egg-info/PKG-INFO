# Supporting python modules for X

Python package for the replication package of the paper.
It includes a module that implements the analytical model described in the paper.
It also includes a module for creating plots of this model, as well as plots from finite element calculations output from a related package ([name]()) and plots from Monte Carlo simulations from another related package ([name]()).

Some example scripts for creating plots are provided in the [`scripts`](scripts/) directory.
More examples can be found in the data [component of the replication package]().

## Installation

This package was developed and used on Linux.
[It is available on the PyPi respository]().
It can be installed by running

If you do not have root access and it does not automatically default to installing locally, the `--user` flag may be used.
To install directly from this repository, run
