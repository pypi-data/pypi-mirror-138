        # Salt Nornir
        
        Repository to store Nornir based SaltStack modules:
        
        - salt-nornir proxy minion module
        - salt-nornir execution module
        - salt-nornir state module
        - salt-nornir runner module
        
        Nornir Proxy Minion helps to manage network devices at scale, reference
        [documentation](https://salt-nornir.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html)

        Nornir Proxy acts as a bridge between SaltStack and a wide set of network automation libraries.
        
        # Advantages
        
        Some notable benefits:
        
        - Well tested - overall 426 tests for `salt-nornir` and `nornir-salt` packages combined as of release 0.9.0
        - Brings together SaltStack and a wealth of open-source libraries - Nornir, Netmiko, NAPALM, Scrapli, Scrapli-Netconf, Ncclient, Genie&PyATS (free, not open-source), PyGNMI, NTC-Templates, TTP, Jmespath, lxml, xmltodict, requests
        - Capable of addressing overwhelming set of use cases from simple data retrieval and parsing to infrastructure provisioning, testing, orchestration and self-healing
        - Python is a first class citizen, need something special - write your own plugins, modules, scripts, codify your work flows
        - Integrate anything with anything, all you can do via CLI you can do via SaltStack and Nornir Python API or SaltStack REST API
