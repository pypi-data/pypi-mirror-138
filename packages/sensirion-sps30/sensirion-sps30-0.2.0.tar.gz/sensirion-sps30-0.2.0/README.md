This is a simple library to communicate with a [Sensirion SPS30](https://sensirion.com/products/catalog/SPS30/) sensor via Serial communication. 
The SPS30 is an MCERTS-certified particulate matter sensor based on laser scattering measurement principles. 
It can classify particles within PM1.0, PM2.5, PM4 and PM10 categories. 

For further details refer to the official [documentation](https://sensirion.com/media/documents/8600FF88/616542B5/Sensirion_PM_Sensors_Datasheet_SPS30.pdf) of the sensor.

## Usage

Example Python script to read and print a single measurement.

```python
from time import sleep

from sensirion_sps30 import SPS30

port: str = "COM3"
sps30 = SPS30(port)

sps30.start_measurement()
sleep(5)

data = sps30.read_values()
print(data)

sps30.stop_measurement()
```
