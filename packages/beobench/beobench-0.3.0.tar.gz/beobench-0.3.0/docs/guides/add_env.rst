Adding your own environment
-----------------------------

This guide explains how to add a new reinforcement learning (RL) environment to beobench.

.. topic:: Why should I use this?

    Adding your RL environment to beobench allows you to test all of beobench's methods on your environment without actually implementing any methods yourself. Instead of just testing a single method configuration, beobench will automatically test a range of method configurations -- taking care of basic hyperparameter tuning. Additionally, beobench gives you access to all other RL methods available in RLlib.


Creating build context
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

To add an environment to beobench we need to create a special *docker build context* (for more details `see the official docker build documentation <https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/commandline/build/>`_). Such a beobench-specific *docker build context* consists at least of the following two files in a folder ``<your_gym_name>/``:

1. A dockerfile ``Dockerfile`` that defines a docker container that has everything necessary for your environment installed. In addition to any of your packages/modules, the dockerfile must also install `beobench` via pip.
2. A ``env_creator.py`` file that defines a function with the signature ``create_env(env_config: dict = None) -> gym.Env``. This ``create_env()`` function should take an ``env_config`` dictionary (that completely configures your environment) as input and return an instance of your environment with this configuration. If your environment is not yet implementing the commonly used ``gym.Env`` class (`see here <https://github.com/openai/gym/blob/e9df4932434516c9f7956cc8010679a33835b204/gym/core.py#L17>`_), you will need to wrap your environment in a class that implements this ``gym.Env`` class within the ``create_env()`` function.

The path to the folder with these two files, ``path/to/folder/<your_gym_name>/``, can either be on your local file system or on github. It can also contain additional files that help with the installation process.

**Example**: for an example of such a *docker context folder* see `the official BOPTEST integration folder <https://github.com/rdnfn/beobench/tree/master/beobench/integrations/boptest>`_.


Defining experiment
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

In order run an experiment on your gym, we need to add the build context to an experiment definition. This can be done by adding/changing the following parameter in your experiment definition file ``example_experiment_def.py`` (see the :doc:`usage` page for how to create a complete experiment definition file):

.. code-block:: python

    problem = {
        "problem_library": "path/to/folder/<your_gym_name>/",
        ...
    }

For example, we could set the ``problem_library`` key to ``"https://github.com/rdnfn/beobench.git#master:beobench/integrations/boptest"``.

.. warning::

    Only set ``problem_library`` to experiment build contexts from authors that you trust. This setting can create an arbitrary docker container on your system.

Running experiment
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

With a complete experiment definition file ``example_experiment_def.py``, we can then use the standard command below to start the experiment:

.. include:: ../snippets/run_standard_experiment.rst

Done! You have now successfully integrated your RL environment with beobench.
