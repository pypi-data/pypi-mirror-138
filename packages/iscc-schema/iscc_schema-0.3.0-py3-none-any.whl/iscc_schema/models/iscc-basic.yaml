    description: Descriptive, industry-sector or use-case specific metadata. Can be any object
      that is JSON/JCS serializable. If `metadata` is provided it is used as an input for
      Meta-Code generation and as the sole input for the cryptographic `metahash` calculation.
      If `metadata` is set to a string it is assumed that it is base64 encoded binary file
      metadata.
