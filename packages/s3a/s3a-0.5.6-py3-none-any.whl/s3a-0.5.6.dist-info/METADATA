# Semi-Supervised Semantic Annotator (S3A)

A highly adaptable tool for both visualizing and generating semantic annotations for generic images.

Most software solutions for semantic (pixel-level) labeling are designed for low-resolution (<10MB) images with fewer than 10 components of interest. Violating either constraint (e.g. using a high-res image or annotating ~1000 components) incur detrimental performance impacts. S3A is designed to combat both these deficiencies. With images up to 150 MB and 2000 components, the tool remains interactive.

## Installation

The easiest method for installing `s3a` is via `pip` after cloning the repository, or directly from pypi:

```bash
git clone https://gitlab.com/ficsresearch/s3a
pip install -e ./s3a

# Or from pypi using "pip install s3a"
```

Note that a version of OpenCV and Qt binding are required for S3A to work. These can be installed for you with the "turnkey" option:
```bash
pip install -e ./s3a[full]
# Or "pip install s3a[full]"
```

## Running the App
Running the app is as easy as calling `s3a` as a module:
`python -m s3a`

From here, projects can be created to host groups of related images, or images can be annotated in the default project. Both options are available through the `File` menu.
