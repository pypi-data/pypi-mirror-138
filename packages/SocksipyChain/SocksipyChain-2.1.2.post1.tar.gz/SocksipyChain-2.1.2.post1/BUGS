KNOWN BUGS AND ISSUES
---------------------

There are no currently known bugs in this module.
There are some limits though:

1) Only outgoing connections are supported - This module currently only
supports outgoing TCP connections, though some servers may support incoming
connections as well. UDP is not supported either.

2) GSSAPI Socks5 authenticaion is not supported.

3) SSL host name verification using pyOpenSSL does not check the Subject
   ALT Name extension, only the common name.  This is due to limitations
   in pyOpenSSL itself.
