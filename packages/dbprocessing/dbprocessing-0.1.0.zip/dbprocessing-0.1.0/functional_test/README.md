test_DB
=======

What this is:
-------------
The goal here is to have the simplest test of dbprocessing so testing is quick
and complete without having to use real data. Level 0 files are just simple
words stored in testDB_{set}_(first|sec).raw format. Level 1 files are the
concatenated versions of level 0, stored in testDB_{set}.cat format. Level 2
files are rot13â€™d versions of the level 1 files, and are stored in
testDB_{set}.rot format.


How to run this:
----------------
Eventually, this will be a full unittest suite and will simply be run that way,
but for now functionalTest.py will execute the needed scripts to run the
entire dbprocessing chain.

Relation to unit tests:
-----------------------
The unit tests run assuming the state of the database and directories
AFTER the functional tests are run. This is the state that's checked
in to the repository. The functional test does not use the actual
state in the repo (it works in a temporary directory.) The relevant
state can be copied from the temporary directory after a functional
run if necessary
