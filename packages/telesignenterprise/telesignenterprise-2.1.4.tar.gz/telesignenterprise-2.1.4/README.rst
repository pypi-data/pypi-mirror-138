For more information about TeleSign, visit our `website <http://www.TeleSign.com>`_.

Documentation
-------------

Code documentation is included in the SDK. Complete documentation, quick start guides, and reference material
for TeleSign APIs is available in the `TeleSign Enterprise Documentation <https://enterprise.telesign.com/>`_.

Installation
------------

To install the TeleSign Enterprise Python SDK:

.. code-block:: bash

    $ pip install -e /path/to/python_telesign_enterprise

Python **2.7+** or **3.7+** is required for the TeleSign Enterprise Python SDK.

Authentication
--------------

You need a Customer ID and API Key to use the TeleSign SDK. If you are already a customer and need an
API Key, you can retrieve it from `TelePortal <https://teleportal.telesign.com>`_.

Dependencies
------------

We make use of popular, feature-rich, and well-tested open-source libraries to perform the underlying functionality of
the SDK. These dependencies are managed by the community accepted package manager. If you are unable to add these
additional third-party dependencies to your project we have ensured that the SDK code is easy to read and can serve as
sample code. We have also made sure that more complicated functions such as generate_telesign_headers can be easily
extracted from the SDK and used 'as is' in your project.

Python Code Example: Verify SMS
-------------------------------

Here is a basic code example with JSON response.

.. code-block:: python

    from __future__ import print_function
    from telesignenterprise.verify import VerifyClient

    customer_id = "FFFFFFFF-EEEE-DDDD-1234-AB1234567890"
    api_key = "EXAMPLE----TE8sTgg45yusumoN6BYsBVkh+yRJ5czgsnCehZaOYldPJdmFh6NeX8kunZ2zU1YWaUw/0wV6xfw=="

    phone_number = "phone_number"

    verify_client = VerifyClient(customer_id, api_key)
    response = verify_client.sms(phone_number)

    print(response.json)

.. code-block:: javascript

    {'errors': [],
     'reference_id': '25685A40218006049044A58789044948',
     'resource_uri': '/v1/verify/25685A40218006049044A58789044948',
     'status': {'code': 290,
        'description': 'Message in progress',
        'updated_on': '2017-02-07T03:13:42.610863Z'},
     'sub_resource': 'sms',
     'verify': {'code_entered': '',
        'code_state': 'UNKNOWN'}}
