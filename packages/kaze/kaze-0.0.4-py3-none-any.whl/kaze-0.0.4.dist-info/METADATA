Kaze, A CLI for Dataset Dependencies in ML Projects |image1|
============================================================

What is Kaze?
-------------

Installation
------------

.. code-block:: bash

   pip install kaze

Example Usage
-------------

To download a dataset, you can use the following command:

.. code-block:: bash

   kaze add mnist https://s3.amazonaws.com/kaze-datasets/mnist.zip

this will populate your ``.datasets.yml`` file with the following:

.. code-block:: yaml

   datasets:
     - name: mnist
       source: https://s3.amazonaws.com/kaze-datasets/mnist.zip
       path: mnist
       type: zip

You can also add a dataset from a local file:

.. code-block:: yaml

   kaze add mnist mnist.zip

And finally, you can download a dataset from a remote URL:

.. code-block:: yaml

   kaze add mnist https://s3.amazonaws.com/kaze-datasets/mnist.zip
