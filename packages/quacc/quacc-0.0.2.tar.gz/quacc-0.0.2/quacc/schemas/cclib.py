    """
    Get tabulated results from a molecular DFT run and store them in a database-friendly format.
    This is meant to be a general parser built on top of cclib.

    Parameters
    ----------
    atoms
        ASE Atoms object following a calculation.
    logfile_extensions
        Possible extensions of the log file (e.g. ".log", ".out", ".txt", ".chk"). Note that
        only a partial match is needed. For instance, `.log` will match `.log.gz` and `.log.1.gz`.
        If multiple files with this extension are found, the one with the most recent change time
        will be used. For an exact match only, put in the full file name.
    dir_name
        The path to the folder containing the calculation outputs. A value of None specifies the
        current working directory.
    prep_next_run
        Whether the Atoms object storeed in {"atoms": atoms} should be prepared for the next run.
        This clears out any attached calculator and moves the final magmoms to the initial magmoms.
    additional_fields
        Additional fields to add to the task document.

    Returns
    -------
    Dict
        Dictionary of tabulated inputs/results
