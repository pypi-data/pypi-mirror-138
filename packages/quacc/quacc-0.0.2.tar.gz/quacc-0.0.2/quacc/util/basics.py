    Merges two dictionaries into a single dictionary. If both dictionaries

    ----------
    d1
        First dictionary.
    d2
        Second dictionary, which has priority.
    remove_none
        If True, all keys with a value of None in the merged dictionary will be removed.
    remove_false
        If True, all keys with a value of False in the merged dictionary will be removed.
