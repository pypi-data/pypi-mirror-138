# PECF
(Python easy configuration file's)
 
PECF is my config. language for python. It is only developing, so please do not judge strictly. I will be glad of any constructive criticism. PECF is very easy and understood for people. At this stage PECF has no division into int or string but it will be adding in nearest updates.

# Why PECF?

Easy code readability by both human and computer

Speed (Higher than JSON)

Convenience
