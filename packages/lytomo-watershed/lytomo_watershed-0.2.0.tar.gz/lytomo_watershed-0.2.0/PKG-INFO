Description: # LyTomo-Watershed
        Characterizing proto-clusters/groups in Lyman-alpha Tomography
        
        The repository for reproducing the results in [Qezlou et al. 2021](https://arxiv.org/abs/2112.03930)
        
        ### Cookbook :
        
        There is a step-by-step cookbook in [`CookBook.ipynb`](https://github.com/mahdiqezlou/LyTomo-Watershed/blob/main/CookBook.ipynb)
        
        ### Requirements :
        
        Each part of the production has a different package requirements. 
        Please, review the imported packages in each section. A complete list is :
        
        
        - numpy
        - scipy
        - scikit-image
        - fake_spectra
        - mpi4py
        
        ### Installing the package:
        
        via pip:
        
        ` pip install lytomo_watershed`
        
        or cloning this repo and :
        
        ` python3 setup.py install `
        
        ### Generated Data
        
        - The generated data are available here [![DOI](https://zenodo.org/badge/DOI/10.5281/zenodo.5770883.svg)](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.5770883). 
        - Refer to the `CookBook.ipynb` and other notebooks to see which data you need at each step. 
        - A clear descitption of each file is provided on the Zenodo website. 
        
        - You can use `get_data.py` script to download the files from the shell.
        
             1. Get your access token from [here](https://zenodo.org/account/settings/applications/tokens/new/)
             
             2. To downlaod all the compressed files, run this on your shell:
             ```
             python get_data.py -t "Your ACCESS TOKEN"
             ```
             If you want to download a particular compressed file, pass the file name like this :
        
            ```
             python get_data.py -t "Your ACCESS TOKEN" -f 'descendats.zip'
             ```
             3. Don't forget to decompress the downloaded files.

        Note : The observed LATIS data [Newman et al. 2020](https://arxiv.org/abs/2002.10676) is not publicly released yet. 
               Please stay tuned for a near future paper!
