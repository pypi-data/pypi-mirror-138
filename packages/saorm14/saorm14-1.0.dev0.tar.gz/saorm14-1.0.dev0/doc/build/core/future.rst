.. _core_future_toplevel:

SQLAlchemy 2.0 Future (Core)
============================

This package includes a relatively small number of transitional elements
to allow "2.0 mode" to take place within SQLAlchemy 1.4.

In the 2.0 release of SQLAlchemy, the objects published here are the same
:class:`_engine.Engine`, :class:`_engine.Connection` and
:func:`_sa.create_engine`  classes and functions that are
used by default.  The package is here for backwards compatibility with
SQLAlchemy 1.4.

The ``sqlalchemy.future`` package will be deprecated in a subsequent
2.x release and eventually removed.
