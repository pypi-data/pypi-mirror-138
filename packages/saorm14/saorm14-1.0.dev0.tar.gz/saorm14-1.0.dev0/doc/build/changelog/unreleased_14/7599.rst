    Improvements to the test suite's integration with pytest such that the
    "warnings" plugin, if manually enabled, will not interfere with the test
    suite, such that third parties can enable the warnings plugin or make use
    of the ``-W`` parameter and SQLAlchemy's test suite will continue to pass.
    Additionally, modernized the detection of the "pytest-xdist" plugin so that
    plugins can be globally disabled using PYTEST_DISABLE_PLUGIN_AUTOLOAD=1
    without breaking the test suite if xdist were still installed. Warning
    filters that promote deprecation warnings to errors are now localized to
    SQLAlchemy-specific warnings, or within SQLAlchemy-specific sources for
    general Python deprecation warnings, so that non-SQLAlchemy deprecation
    warnings emitted from pytest plugins should also not impact the test suite.
