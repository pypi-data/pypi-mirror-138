    Adjusted the logging for key SQLAlchemy components including
    :class:`_engine.Engine`, :class:`_engine.Connection` to establish an
    appropriate stack level parameter, so that the Python logging tokens
    ``funcName`` and ``lineno`` when used in custom logging formatters will
    report the correct information, which can be useful when filtering log
    output; supported on Python 3.8 and above. Pull request courtesy Markus
