    Added an additional lookup step to the compiler which will track all FROM
    clauses which are tables, that may have the same name shared in multiple
    schemas where one of the schemas is the implicit "default" schema; in this
    case, the table name when referring to that name without a schema
    qualification will be rendered with an anonymous alias name at the compiler
    level in order to disambiguate the two (or more) names. The approach of
    schema-qualifying the normally unqualified name with the server-detected
    "default schema name" value was also considered, however this approach
    doesn't apply to Oracle nor is it accepted by SQL Server, nor would it work
    with multiple entries in the PostgreSQL search path. The name collision
    issue resolved here has been identified as affecting at least Oracle,
    PostgreSQL, SQL Server, MySQL and MariaDB.
