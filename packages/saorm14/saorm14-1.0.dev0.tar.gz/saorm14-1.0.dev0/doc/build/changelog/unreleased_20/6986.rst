    The internals for the :class:`_orm.Load` object and related loader strategy
    patterns have been mostly rewritten, to take advantage of the fact that
    only attribute-bound paths, not strings, are now supported. The rewrite
    hopes to make it more straightforward to address new use cases and subtle
    issues within the loader strategy system going forward.
