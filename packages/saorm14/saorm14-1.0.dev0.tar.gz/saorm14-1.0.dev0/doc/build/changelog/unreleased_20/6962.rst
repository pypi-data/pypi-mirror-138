    The :paramref:`_sa.create_engine.implicit_returning` parameter is
    deprecated on the :func:`_sa.create_engine` function only; the parameter
    remains available on the :class:`_schema.Table` object. This parameter was
    originally intended to enable the "implicit returning" feature of
    SQLAlchemy when it was first developed and was not enabled by default.
    Under modern use, there's no reason this parameter should be disabled, and
    it has been observed to cause confusion as it degrades performance and
    makes it more difficult for the ORM to retrieve recently inserted server
    defaults. The parameter remains available on :class:`_schema.Table` to
    specifically suit database-level edge cases which make RETURNING
    infeasible, the sole example currently being SQL Server's limitation that
    INSERT RETURNING may not be used on a table that has INSERT triggers on it.

    Related to the deprecation for
    :paramref:`_sa.create_engine.implicit_returning`, the "implicit_returning"
    feature is now enabled for the Oracle dialect in all cases; previously, the
    feature would be turned off when an Oracle 8/8i version were detected,
    however online documentation indicates both versions support the same
    RETURNING syntax as modern versions.
