    The :meth:`_engine.Inspector.has_table` method will now consistently check
    for views of the given name as well as tables. Previously this behavior was
    dialect dependent, with PostgreSQL, MySQL/MariaDB and SQLite supporting it,
    and Oracle and SQL Server not supporting it. Third party dialects should
    also seek to ensure their :meth:`_engine.Inspector.has_table` method
    searches for views as well as tables for the given name.
