.. change::
    :tags: postgresql, dialect
    :tickets: 6842

    Added support for ``psycopg`` dialect supporting both sync and async
    execution. This dialect is available under the ``postgresql+psycopg`` name
    for both the :func:`_sa.create_engine` and
    :func:`_asyncio.create_async_engine` engine-creation functions.
