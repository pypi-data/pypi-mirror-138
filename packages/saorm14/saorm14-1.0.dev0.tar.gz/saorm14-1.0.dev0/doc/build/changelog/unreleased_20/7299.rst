    Removed the warning that emits from the :class:`_types.Numeric` type about
    DBAPIs not supporting Decimal values natively. This warning was oriented
    towards SQLite, which does not have any real way without additional
    extensions or workarounds of handling precision numeric values more than 15
    significant digits as it only uses floating point math to represent
    numbers. As this is a known and documented limitation in SQLite itself, and
    not a quirk of the pysqlite driver, there's no need for SQLAlchemy to warn
    for this. The change does not otherwise modify how precision numerics are
    handled. Values can continue to be handled as ``Decimal()`` or ``float()``
    as configured with the :class:`_types.Numeric`, :class:`_types.Float` , and
    related datatypes, just without the ability to maintain precision beyond 15
    significant digits when using SQLite, unless alternate representations such
    as strings are used.
