    The SQLite dialect now defaults to :class:`_pool.QueuePool` when a file
    based database is used. This is set along with setting the
    ``check_same_thread`` parameter to ``False``. It has been observed that the
    previous approach of defaulting to :class:`_pool.NullPool`, which does not
    hold onto database connections after they are released, did in fact have a
    measurable negative performance impact. As always, the pool class is always
    customizable via the :paramref:`_sa.create_engine.poolclass` parameter.
