    Implemented full support for "truediv" and "floordiv" using the
    "/" and "//" operators.  A "truediv" operation between two expressions
    using :class:`_types.Integer` now considers the result to be
    :class:`_types.Numeric`, and the dialect-level compilation will cast
    the right operand to a numeric type on a dialect-specific basis to ensure
    truediv is achieved.  For floordiv, conversion is also added for those
    databases that don't already do floordiv by default (MySQL, Oracle) and
    the ``FLOOR()`` function is rendered in this case, as well as for
    cases where the right operand is not an integer (needed for PostgreSQL,
    others).

    The change resolves issues both with inconsistent behavior of the
    division operator on different backends and also fixes an issue where
    integer division on Oracle would fail to be able to fetch a result due
    to inappropriate outputtypehandlers.
