#### What is this?
Sankaku.py is a Python API for communicating with Sankaku Complex's Servers while pretending that you're an App User. This is mostly accomplished by spoofing Device Configuration Headers, while objectifying and organizing Amino Response Data, so that actually doing anything is easier.


#### How do I use this?
Python 3.8 is the recommended version for Sankaku.py, only supports Python 3.x.

To install Amino.py, run `python3 -m pip install sankaku.py`.
- **NOTE:** MAKE SURE YOU TYPE `sankaku.py` **NOT** `sankaku` AS IT WILL INSTALL THE **WRONG** PACKAGE!


### API Reference
*Soon...*


#### Alternative Installation (Not recommended)
0. Make sure pip is installed and added to PATH, see: [How to setup pip](https://nitratine.net/blog/post/how-to-setup-pythons-pip/)
1. Alternatively download the API from GitHub [here](https://github.com/Slimakoi/Amino.py/archive/refs/heads/master.zip)
2. Extract the .zip file either with [WinRAR](https://www.win-rar.com/download.html?&L=0) or [7-Zip](https://www.7-zip.org/download.html)
3. Open the extracted folder in an IDE of your choice, and navigate to the folder named `Sankaku.py-master`
4. Select the Python Interpreter
5. Make a new `*.py` file and start coding
