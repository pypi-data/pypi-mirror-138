doc = 'In an attempt to build an AI-ready workforce, Microsoft announced ' \
'Intelligent Cloud Hub which has been launched to empower the next generation ' \
'of students with AI-ready skills. Envisioned as a three-year collaborative ' \
'program, Intelligent Cloud Hub will support around 100 institutions with AI ' \
'infrastructure, course content and curriculum, developer support, development ' \
'tools and give students access to cloud and AI services. As part of the ' \
'program, the Redmond giant which wants to expand its reach and is planning ' \
'to build a strong developer ecosystem in India with the program will set up ' \
'the core AI infrastructure and IoT Hub for the selected campuses. The company ' \
'will provide AI development tools and Azure AI services such as Microsoft ' \
'Cognitive Services, Bot Services and Azure Machine Learning. According to ' \
'Manish Prakash, Country General Manager-PS, Health and Education, Microsoft ' \
'India, said, "With AI being the defining technology of our time, it is ' \
'transforming lives and industry and the jobs of tomorrow will require a ' \
'different skillset. This will require more collaborations and training and ' \
'working with AI. That’s why it has become more critical than ever for ' \
'educational institutions to integrate new cloud and AI technologies. The ' \
'program is an attempt to ramp up the institutional set-up and build capabilities ' \
'among the educators to educate the workforce of tomorrow." The program aims to ' \
'build up the cognitive skills and in-depth understanding of developing ' \
'intelligent cloud connected solutions for applications across industry. Earlier ' \
'in April this year, the company announced Microsoft Professional Program In AI ' \
'as a learning track open to the public. The program was developed to provide ' \
'job ready skills to programmers who wanted to hone their skills in AI and data ' \
'science with a series of online courses which featured hands-on labs and expert ' \
'instructors as well. This program also included developer-focused AI school ' \
'that provided a bunch of assets to help build AI skills.'

```

Output from the above:

Bag-of-words summary:

This will require more collaborations and training and working with AI. That’s
why it has become more critical than ever for educational institutions to 
integrate new cloud and AI technologies. According to Manish Prakash, Country 
General Manager-PS, Health and Education, Microsoft India, said, "With AI being
the defining technology of our time, it is transforming lives and industry and
the jobs of tomorrow will require a different skillset. The program was

Embedding summary:

In an attempt to build an AI-ready workforce, Microsoft announced Intelligent
Cloud Hub which has been launched to empower the next generation of students
with AI-ready skills. Envisioned as a three-year collaborative program,
Intelligent Cloud Hub will support around 100 institutions with AI

## About

This package is derived from the [original implementation](https://github.com/gaetangate/text-summarizer) by the authors of the paper "Centroid-based Text Summarization through Compositionality of Word Embeddings" accepted at MultiLing Workshop at EACL 2017. http://www.aclweb.org/anthology/W17-1003

The method is described in [A Better Approach to Text Summarization](https://towardsdatascience.com/a-better-approach-to-text-summarization-d7139b571439) by [@vinimonteiro](https://github.com/vinimonteiro).
