        Relatives Import Tool : How many time I was blocked by relative import problems. This time is over now...
        
        # Installation
        ```
        pip install ritl
        ```
        
        # Usage
        
        We just need to put :
        ```
        from ritl import relative_import
        relative_import.add(__file__)
        ```
        and we can import easily our modules in the same directory of our file. Wherever you execute it.
        
        You can also add more directories, relative to your file directory :
        ```
        relative_import.add(__file__, "../utils")
        ```
        
        This will allow you to relatively import your modules from other directory in utils
        
        After this, you just have to import your modules
