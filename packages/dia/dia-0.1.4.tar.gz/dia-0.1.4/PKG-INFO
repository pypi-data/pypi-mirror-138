Dia
===

Have you ever spent a long day at work, only to wonder at the end of it what you
actually got done? Do you wish you remembered why you made a decision way back when?
Do you want to find the day you worked on a specific thing, but haven't left any trace?

Dia solves all those problems by helping you keep a work diary.


Installation
------------

Installing Dia is simple. You can use `pipx` (recommended):

```bash
$ pipx install dia
```

Or `pip` (less recommended):

```bash
$ pip install dia
```


Usage
-----

To log a task you've completed, you can use `dia log`:

```bash
$ dia log "Completed the diary feature."
```

This will generate the following `log.txt` in the current directory (or append to it if
it already exists):

```md
Work diary
==========


2022-02-09
----------

* Completed the diary feature.
```

If you want to specify a fixed file to always work on, you can do that by setting the
`diary` option in `~/.config/dia/config`:

```ini
diary="/home/stavros/diary.txt"
```

You can similarly override any other options.


Semantic tags
-------------

Dia supports (though currently very tenuously) semantic tags. This means it can
understand people, projects, and tags. For example, you can say:

```bash
$ dia log "Worked on the %Dia #data-model with @JohnK."
```
