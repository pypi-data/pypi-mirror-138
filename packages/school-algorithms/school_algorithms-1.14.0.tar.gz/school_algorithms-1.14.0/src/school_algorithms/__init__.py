school_algorithms
=================

school_algorithms is a Python module for secondary school
maths and physics equations.

It aims to provide a simple way for secondary school students
to learn and calculate equations that they often use.

How to use documentation
------------------------
Documentation is provided in the form of docstrings provided
with the code.

The docstring examples assume that 'school_algorithms' has been imported::

    >>> import school_algorithms

Code snippets are indicated by three greater-than signs

    >>> x = 42
    >>> x = x + 1

Use the built-in ``help`` function to view a function's docstring::

    >>> help(school_algorithms.power_calc)
