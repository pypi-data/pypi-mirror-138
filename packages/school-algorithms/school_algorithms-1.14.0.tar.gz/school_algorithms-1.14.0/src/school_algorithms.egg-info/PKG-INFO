# **School Algorithms**
  ***school_algorithms is a Python module for secondary school maths and physics equations.
  It aims to provide a simple way for secondary school students
  to learn and calculate equations that they often use.***

### Functions include:
- _A function that calculates power from energy and time_
- _A function that calculates energy from power and time_
- _A function that calculates time from power and energy_
- _A function that uses Pythagorean theorem to calculate the hypotenuse of a right-angled triangle_
- _A function that uses Pythagorean theorem to calculate a leg of a right-angled triangle_
- _A function that calculates the area of a triangle_
- _A function that calculates the area of a trapezium_
- _A function that calculates the volume of a right rectangle pyramid_
- _A function that calculates the area of a circle_
- _A function that calculates the circumference of a circle_
- _A function that calculates the circumference of a circle using diameter_
- _A function that calculates the area of a sector in a circle_
- _A function that calculates the volume of a square based pyramid_
- _A function that calculates the Lowest Common Multiple from 2 numbers_
- _A function that calculates the Lowest Common Multiple from 3 numbers_
- _A function that calculates the Lowest Common Multiple from 4 numbers_
- _A function that calculates the Lowest Common Multiple from 5 numbers_


### To install:

    >>> python3 -m pip install school_algorithms

### To upgrade to latest version:

    >>> python3 -m pip --upgrade school_algorithms

### To import:

    >>> import school_algorithms










## How to use documentation:
##### Documentation is in the form of docstrings provided with the code.

##### The docstring examples assume that 'school_algorithms' has been imported:

    >>> import school_algorithms

##### Code snippets are indicated by three greater-than signs:

    >>> x = 42
    >>> x = x + 1

##### Use the built-in ``help`` function to view a function's docstring:

    >>> help(school_algorithms.power_calc)
