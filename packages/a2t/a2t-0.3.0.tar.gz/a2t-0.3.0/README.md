This repository contains the code for out of the box ready to use zero-shot classifiers among different tasks, such as Topic Labelling or Relation Extraction. It is built on top of ðŸ¤— HuggingFace [Transformers](https://github.com/huggingface/transformers) library, so you are free to choose among hundreds of models. You can either, use a dataset specific classifier or define one yourself with just labels descriptions or templates! The repository contains the code for the following publications:

- ðŸ“„ [Ask2Transformers - Zero Shot Domain Labelling with Pretrained Transformers](https://aclanthology.org/2021.gwc-1.6/) accepted in [GWC2021](http://globalwordnet.org/global-wordnet-conferences-2/).
- ðŸ“„ [Label Verbalization and Entailment for Effective Zero- and Few-Shot Relation Extraction](https://aclanthology.org/2021.emnlp-main.92/) accepted in [EMNLP2021](https://2021.emnlp.org/)

<!-- ### Supported (and benchmarked) tasks:
Follow the links to see some examples of how to use the library on each task.
- [Topic classification](./a2t/topic_classification/) evaluated on BabelDomains (Camacho-
Collados and Navigli, 2017)  dataset.
- [Relation classification](./a2t/relation_classification/) evaluated on TACRED (Zhang et al., 2017) dataset. -->

To get started with the repository consider reading the **new** [documentation](https://osainz59.github.io/Ask2Transformers)!

## Available models
By default, `roberta-large-mnli` checkpoint is used to perform the inference. You can try different models to perform the zero-shot classification, but they need to be finetuned on a NLI task and be compatible with the `AutoModelForSequenceClassification` class from Transformers. For example:

* `roberta-large-mnli`
* `joeddav/xlm-roberta-large-xnli`
* `facebook/bart-large-mnli`
* `microsoft/deberta-v2-xlarge-mnli` 

**Coming soon:** `t5-large` like generative models support.

## Training your own models
There is no special script for fine-tuning your own entailment based models. In our experiments, we have used the publicly available [run_glue.py](https://github.com/huggingface/transformers/blob/master/examples/pytorch/text-classification/run_glue.py) python script (from HuggingFace Transformers). To train your own model, first, you will need to convert your actual dataset in some sort of NLI data, we recommend you to have a look to [tacred2mnli.py](https://github.com/osainz59/Ask2Transformers/blob/master/scripts/tacred2mnli.py) script that serves as an example.

## Results

    abstract = "Relation extraction systems require large amounts of labeled examples which are costly to annotate. In this work we reformulate relation extraction as an entailment task, with simple, hand-made, verbalizations of relations produced in less than 15 min per relation. The system relies on a pretrained textual entailment engine which is run as-is (no training examples, zero-shot) or further fine-tuned on labeled examples (few-shot or fully trained). In our experiments on TACRED we attain 63{\%} F1 zero-shot, 69{\%} with 16 examples per relation (17{\%} points better than the best supervised system on the same conditions), and only 4 points short to the state-of-the-art (which uses 20 times more training data). We also show that the performance can be improved significantly with larger entailment models, up to 12 points in zero-shot, allowing to report the best results to date on TACRED when fully trained. The analysis shows that our few-shot systems are specially effective when discriminating between relations, and that the performance difference in low data regimes comes mainly from identifying no-relation cases.",

Furthermore, the system is not restricted to use a particular set of domain labels. We exploit the knowledge encoded within different off-the-shelf pre-trained Language Models and task formulations to infer the domain label of a particular WordNet definition.
