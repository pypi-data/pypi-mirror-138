Description: acpic - an acpid client
        =======================
        
        This little daemon extends [acpid](https://sourceforge.net/projects/acpid2/)
        event handling capabilities. Normally, event handlers are placed by root in
        `/etc/acpi/events/`. With acpic, you can place additional handlers in a per-user
        `~/.config/acpi/events/` directory.
        
        I personally use it to control PulseAudio with hardware volume buttons on my
        laptop (see [examples](example-events/)).
