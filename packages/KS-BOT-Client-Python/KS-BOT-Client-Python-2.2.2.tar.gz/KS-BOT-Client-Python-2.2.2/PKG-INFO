Description: # KS-BOT-Client-Python
        
        ### Python framework for interacting with KS-BOT, without any app
        
        __To get started simply install ks-bot-client, with the following command__
        ```Python
        
        python -m pip install KS-BOT-Client-Python
        
        ```
        
        ## After Installation:
        
        - Simple import ks-bot-client
        
        ```Python
        import ks_bot_client
        ```
        
        - Next create a custom Bot class by inherenting from ks_bot_client.bot class
        
        ```Python
        
        class CustomBot(ks_bot_client.Bot):
          
          def __init__(self, name:str, password:str):
            """
              :param {string} name - Either Username, First Name of user or email of user
              :param {string} password - User password
            """
        
            super().__init__(name, password)
        
        
          def WelcomeMessage(self, data):
            """
              This event gives you, your previous messages with ks-bot.
              
              > Feel free to customize it
            """
            print("KS-BOT said 'welcome'")
        
        
          def BotProcessReply(self, data):
            """
              Returns bot reply to the message you sent it
        
              > Feel free to customize it
            """
            print("KS-BOT said: ", data)
            
        
          def TimerOver(self, data):
            """
              Handles Event Server sends when timer is over
        
              > Feel free to customize it
            """
        
            print("KS-BOT said: Timer is over, Timer: ", data)
        ```
        
        - Once your custom bot class is ready all that is left is for you to initialize your bot
        
        ```Python
        bot = CustomBot("<your name>", "<your password>")
        ```
        
        - Last but not list all you have to do is run the bot, so it can get and recieve messages from Server
        
        ```Python
        bot.run()
        ```
        
        - Now that your bot is recieving messages from server and can send message to server, Send your first message!
        
        ```Python
        bot.send_command("<your message>", "<the timeZone you want to send the message from, default timeZone is your actual timeZone>", <log : True|False>)
        ```
