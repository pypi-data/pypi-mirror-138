        Opens a new client connection to NetsBlox, allowing you to access any of the NetsBlox services from python.

        `proj_name` and `proj_id` control the public name of your project from other programs.
        For instance, these are needed for other programs to send a message to your project.
        If you do not provide them, defaults will be generated (which will work),
        but the public id will change every time, which could be annoying if you need to frequently start/stop your project to make changes.

        `run_forever` prevents the python program from terminating even after the end of your script.
        This is useful if you have long-running programs that are based on message-passing rather than looping.
        Note: this does not stop the main thread of execution from terminating, which could be a problem in environments like Google Colab;
        instead, you can explicitly call `wait_till_disconnect()` at the end of your program.

        utterances, and any required slots. Utterances are examples of how the user might
        phrase questions or commands. Slots are used to define placeholders for concepts
        like names, cities, etc.
        
        When Alexa determines that a request was made to a given intent, the slots are
        resolved to their corresponding values and then passed to the "handler" for the

        Overview
        --------
        
        Like regular Battleship, the Battleship service has two states: placing ships and shooting at ships.
        During placement, it expects each role to place each ship on his/her board and will not allow the game to proceed to the shooting phase until each role has placed all his/her ships.
        Placement, firing and starting blocks will return true if successful or an error message if it fails.
        
        Blocks
        ------
        
        - place <ship> at <row> <column> facing <direction> - Places a ship on your board with the front at the given row and column facing the given direction. Returns true if placed successfully (eg, on the board and not overlapping another ship). Also, placing a ship twice results in a move (not duplicates).
        - start game - Try to start the game. If both users have all their ships placed, it should return true and send start messages to all roles. Otherwise, it will return with a message saying that it is waiting on a specific role.
        - fire at <row> <column> - This block allows the user to try to fire at the given row and column. It returns true if it was a valid move; otherwise it will return an error message like it's not your turn!. On a successful move, the server will send either a hit or miss message to everyone in the room. Then it will send a your turn message to the player to play next.
        - active ships for <role> - This block returns a list of all ships that are still afloat for the given role. If no role is specified, it defaults to the sender's role.
        - all ships - Returns a list of all ship names. Useful in programmatically placing ships.
        - ship length <ship> - Returns the length of the given ship.
        - restart game - Restarts the given game (all boards, etc)
        
        Message Types
        -------------
        
        - start - Received when start game finishes successfully for any role. After game has officially started, users can no longer move ships.
        - your turn - Received when the given role's turn starts.
        - hit - role is the owner of the ship that has been hit. ship is the name of the ship that has been hit, and row and column provide the location on the board where it was hit. sunk provides a true/false value for if the ship was sunk.
        - miss - role is the owner of the board receiving the shot and row and column correspond to the board location or the shot.

        PhoneIoT is a service in NetsBlox <https://netsblox.org/>_ that's meant to teach Internet of Things (IoT) topics as early as K-12 education.
        It allows you to programmatically access your smartphone's sensors and display.
        This includes accessing hardware sensors such as the accelerometer, gyroscope, microphone, camera, and many others depending on the device.
        PhoneIoT also allows you to control a customizable interactive display, enabling you to use your device as a custom remote control, or even create and run distributed (multiplayer) applications.
        The limits are up to your imagination!
        
        To get started using PhoneIoT, download the PhoneIoT app on your mobile device, available for Android <https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=org.netsblox.phoneiot>_ and iOS, and then go to the NetsBlox editor <https://editor.NetsBlox.org>_.
        In the top left of the editor, you should see a grid of several colored tabs.
        Under the Network tab, grab a call block and place it in the center script area.
        Click the first dropdown on the call block and select the PhoneIoT service.
        The second dropdown selects the specific *Remote Procedure Call* (RPC) to execute - see the table of contents  for information about the various RPCs.
        
        Inside the PhoneIoT app on your mobile device, click the button at the top left to open the menu, and then click connect.
        If you successfully connected, you should get a small popup message at the bottom of the screen.
        If you don't see this message, make sure you have either Wi-Fi or mobile data turned on and try again.
        Near the top of the menu, you should see an ID and password, which will be needed to connect to the device from NetsBlox.
        
        Back in NetsBlox, select the setCredentials RPC and give it your ID and password.
        For convenience, you might want to save the ID in a variable (e.g. device), as it will be referenced many times.
        If you click the call block to run it, you should get an OK result, meaning you successfully connected.
        If you don't see this, make sure you entered the ID and password correctly.
        
        You're now ready to start using the other RPCs in PhoneIoT to communicate with the device!

        Note: you should not call this from a message handler (or any function that a message handler calls),

class Battleship:
    '''
    The Battleship Service provides helpful utilities for building a distributed
    game of battleship.
    
    Overview
    --------
    
    Like regular Battleship, the Battleship service has two states: placing ships and shooting at ships.
    During placement, it expects each role to place each ship on his/her board and will not allow the game to proceed to the shooting phase until each role has placed all his/her ships.
    Placement, firing and starting blocks will return true if successful or an error message if it fails.
    
    Blocks
    ------
    
    - place <ship> at <row> <column> facing <direction> - Places a ship on your board with the front at the given row and column facing the given direction. Returns true if placed successfully (eg, on the board and not overlapping another ship). Also, placing a ship twice results in a move (not duplicates).
    - start game - Try to start the game. If both users have all their ships placed, it should return true and send start messages to all roles. Otherwise, it will return with a message saying that it is waiting on a specific role.
    - fire at <row> <column> - This block allows the user to try to fire at the given row and column. It returns true if it was a valid move; otherwise it will return an error message like it's not your turn!. On a successful move, the server will send either a hit or miss message to everyone in the room. Then it will send a your turn message to the player to play next.
    - active ships for <role> - This block returns a list of all ships that are still afloat for the given role. If no role is specified, it defaults to the sender's role.
    - all ships - Returns a list of all ship names. Useful in programmatically placing ships.
    - ship length <ship> - Returns the length of the given ship.
    - restart game - Restarts the given game (all boards, etc)
    
    Message Types
    -------------
    
    - start - Received when start game finishes successfully for any role. After game has officially started, users can no longer move ships.
    - your turn - Received when the given role's turn starts.
    - hit - role is the owner of the ship that has been hit. ship is the name of the ship that has been hit, and row and column provide the location on the board where it was hit. sunk provides a true/false value for if the ship was sunk.
    - miss - role is the owner of the board receiving the shot and row and column correspond to the board location or the shot.

    PhoneIoT is a service in NetsBlox <https://netsblox.org/>_ that's meant to teach Internet of Things (IoT) topics as early as K-12 education.
    It allows you to programmatically access your smartphone's sensors and display.
    This includes accessing hardware sensors such as the accelerometer, gyroscope, microphone, camera, and many others depending on the device.
    PhoneIoT also allows you to control a customizable interactive display, enabling you to use your device as a custom remote control, or even create and run distributed (multiplayer) applications.
    The limits are up to your imagination!
    
    To get started using PhoneIoT, download the PhoneIoT app on your mobile device, available for Android <https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=org.netsblox.phoneiot>_ and iOS, and then go to the NetsBlox editor <https://editor.NetsBlox.org>_.
    In the top left of the editor, you should see a grid of several colored tabs.
    Under the Network tab, grab a call block and place it in the center script area.
    Click the first dropdown on the call block and select the PhoneIoT service.
    The second dropdown selects the specific *Remote Procedure Call* (RPC) to execute - see the table of contents  for information about the various RPCs.
    
    Inside the PhoneIoT app on your mobile device, click the button at the top left to open the menu, and then click connect.
    If you successfully connected, you should get a small popup message at the bottom of the screen.
    If you don't see this message, make sure you have either Wi-Fi or mobile data turned on and try again.
    Near the top of the menu, you should see an ID and password, which will be needed to connect to the device from NetsBlox.
    
    Back in NetsBlox, select the setCredentials RPC and give it your ID and password.
    For convenience, you might want to save the ID in a variable (e.g. device), as it will be referenced many times.
    If you click the call block to run it, you should get an OK result, meaning you successfully connected.
    If you don't see this, make sure you entered the ID and password correctly.
    
    You're now ready to start using the other RPCs in PhoneIoT to communicate with the device!
