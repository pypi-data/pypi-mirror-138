# PyJuliaPkg

Do you want to use [Julia](https://julialang.org/) in your Python script/project/package?
No problem! PyJuliaPkg will help you out!
- Declare the version of Julia you require in a `juliapkg.json` file.
- Add any packages you need too.
- Call `juliapkg.resolve()` et voila, your dependencies are there.
- Use `juliapkg.executable()` to find the Julia executable and `juliapkg.project()` to
  find the project where the packages were installed.
- Virtual environments? PipEnv? Poetry? Conda? No problem! PyJuliaPkg will set up a
  different project for each environment you work in, keeping your dependencies isolated.

## Install

```sh
pip install juliapkg
```

## Declare dependencies

### Functional interface

- `juliapkg.set_julia_compat(version)` declares that you require the given version of Julia.
  The `version` is a Julia compat specifier, so `1.5` matches any `1.*.*` version at least
  `1.5`.
- `juliapkg.add(pkg, uuid, dev=False, version=None, path=None, url=None, rev=None)` adds
  a required package. Its name and UUID are required.
- `juliapkg.rm(pkg)` remove a package.

Note that these functions edit `juliapkg.json` but do not actually install anything.

The file edited can be displayed with `juliapkg.status()`. It will be at the top of your
virtual environment or Conda environment if you are using one, otherwise `~/.pyjuliapkg.json`.

### juliapkg.json

You can also edit `juliapkg.json` directly if you like. Here is an example which requires
Julia v1.*.* and the Example package v0.5.*:
```json
{
    "julia": "1",
    "packages": {
        "Example": {
            "uuid": "7876af07-990d-54b4-ab0e-23690620f79a",
            "version": "0.5",
        }
    }
}
```

PyJuliaPkg looks for `juliapkg.json` files in many locations, namely:
- Your virtual environment or Conda environment.
- `~/.pyjuliapkg.json`
- Every folder and direct sub-folder in `sys.path`.

The last point means that if you put a `juliapkg.json` file in a package, then install
that package, then PyJuliaPkg will find those dependencies and install them.

## Using Julia

- `juliapkg.executable()` returns a compatible Julia executable.
- `juliapkg.project()` returns the project into which the packages have been installed.
- `juliapkg.resolve(force=False)` ensures all the depdencies are installed. You don't
  normally need to do this because the other functions resolve automatically.
