# Coscine Python SDK

![Coscine](data/logo.png)

[Coscine](https://coscine.rwth-aachen.de/) is an integration platform for
research data hosted at RWTH Aachen University.  
For more information about Coscine visit the official [Landing Page](https://coscine.de/).

## About

This python3.x package provides an SDK for interfacing with Coscine. It is maintained and
developed by the community and should not be regarded as an official service of RWTH Aachen.
You can use the package to integrate Coscine in your python applications and easily:
- create, edit or delete projects and resources
- invite and manage project members
- upload and download files, resources and projects
- manage your metadata

Even if you plan on using the API directly in a programming language of your choice,
you might want to take a look at this module as it provides you with a handy
debug mode which logs all requests and responses made in the communication with coscine.
This makes it simple to understand how certain workflows should be implemented or why
something in your implementation might not work.

## Showcase

Here is a sneak peek of what the module is able to do.

```python
import coscine

token: str = "XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX"
client = coscine.Client(token)

project = client.project("My Project")
print(project.name)
print(project.id)

resource = project.resource("My Project Resource")
print(resource.name)
print(resource.pid)

resource.download(path="./datascience/")

files = resource.objects()
for file in files:
	print(file.name)
```

## Documentation

Documentation and installation instructions can be found in the 
[src/examples](./src/examples) directory. The sourcecode has been thoroughly documented
